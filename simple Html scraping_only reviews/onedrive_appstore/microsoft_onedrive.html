                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I can’t praise enough OneDrive. I had been using it since the
                                SkyDrive days. Those days were storage heaven. I was able to rack up to 50 gigabytes of
                                free storage. Well, OneDrive came to life and changed things. Some improved and some got
                                canned like the amount of free storage. That is the only reason it I take one star from
                                it. The good stuff it’s what in my opinion, makes OneDrive the number one app for online
                                storage. Easy to sync files across Windows PC and IOS mobile devices. The integration of
                                OneDrive with Windows Personal files can be somehow problematic since by default makes
                                OneDrive upload everything you put on those folders. If you don’t want every file on
                                those folders getting uploaded and take precious space just change the settings on
                                Windows to stop OneDrive to upload the content on those folders. I found less
                                complicated to just create a new folder on the system Desktop and name it “My OneDrive”
                                then create sub-folders for E-books, Pictures, spreadsheets and so on... then drop there
                                everything I want to sync across mobile devices. That way I have more control over what
                                goes into One Drive instead of letting Windows do it for me. Also makes me be more
                                organized with the content I own.</p>

                                iPad. It’s best if you have an office 365 subscription so that you get the 1TB of
                                storage, which is great for me because it allows me to store all my files easily. It
                                could be A LOT BETTER though. First, it does have files app integration which for some
                                reason only allows you to copy files from the iPad to OneDrive, not to simply move them.
                                Second, they say it has multi window support for iPadOS 13 but not really. Each time you
                                try to add another window, you get an error message saying that you can only open a file
                                in another window, not another file browser. Also you are very limited in terms of sort
                                and view options, you can only view files in a list or as icons. When viewing photos and
                                videos with the icon view, you can’t see the file name and can only do so by clicking
                                the info button for each individual file. It would be much better if you had other view
                                options like some sort of cover flow type view or something else. Also, the scan option
                                is nice but it would be really nice if it had an option to scan book/textbook pages.</p>

                                ie phones, lap tops, and desktops. I took the time to compare each detail between all
                                the options available. Given the amount of storage needed and price I chose to go with
                                OneDrive and it was the best decision. I was able to back up information on all my
                                devices and coincidently a few weeks after my Mac book of 12+ years gave me the black
                                screen of death. What would have been a devastating moment of photos and documents that
                                would have been lost turned into a humorous moment knowing nothing was lost aside from
                                the 12+ year old laptop. I was so grateful I had backed up everything to OneDrive
                                because I didn’t loose anything nor did I have to go through the trouble of paying
                                someone to retrieve the data I would have lost. It was all already saved to OneDrive
                                which I can access from anywhere on any device. Do yourself a favor and bite the bullet
                                and get OneDrive! You can thank me later.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">OneDrive is my go-to cloud storage system, allowing me to
                                store all of my files online and share them easily among my various devices (PC, iPad
                                and iPhone). My Office 365 subscription gives me 1 TB of storage, more than enough for
                                my needs.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">The IOS OneDrive app does a good job displaying your files
                                and folders and lets you easily navigate between them. It works especially well with the
                                Office apps, auto-saving your files as you work with them.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Two major complaints about the app:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">1) If I navigate to a nested folder within my OneDrive
                                folder, switch to a different app and then return to the OneDrive app, it often “resets”
                                to its root folder, forcing me to re-navigate to where I was. This is even more
                                frustrating if I’m viewing one of my files (e.g., a PDF file) within OneDrive. Upon
                                return to OneDrive from another app, the file is closed and I’m back at the root folder,
                                forcing me to reopen the file I was viewing. I have a feeling this is due to limited
                                memory space, but just dumping me out of my current context seems a poor way of handing
                                the memory restriction.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">2) OneDrive is not well integrated with IOS or other apps.
                                For example, if I want to save an online PDF file I find while using one of the browser
                                apps (Safari, Chrome, etc.), there’s an option to save it to DropBox but not to
                                OneDrive. I usually end up having to save the file to Dropbox, import it to the Adobe
                                Reader app, save it to OneDrive from there, and delete the copy on Dropbox.</p>

                                is not very user friendly on instructions. I had to cut files from my primary folders on
                                my computer and paste them in folders on my desktop (or anywhere else), because I could
                                not get the system to only save the files I wanted. You’re supposed to be able to choose
                                which files go to OneDrive, but I still can’t get the system to do that so things like
                                pictures and PDFs, which take a lot of space, have been moved out of My Pictures and My

                                in love with this for being able to access files. If you’re concerned about losing
                                files, you can save them directly to OneDrive, as compared to having it on your
                                computer. Good luck and enjoy.</p>

                                to share on to my social media. I’ve tried really hard to like this app but it only
                                gives you 5gb for the free package and then if you want more gb’s you have to upgrade
                                and start paying 6.99 or more (can’t remember how much the last package is) every month.
                                Imo to me that’s not worth it b/c I only use this for gaming clips to save onto my phone
                                like I said. Even though I do have the extra space in my OneDrive, my clips seem to
                                NEVER pop up in my folders even when I’m constantly deleting and moving it back over
                                again to see if it will appear. I just find it very frustrating to have to deal with
                                that especially when I still have space and idk, the app just seems to process really
                                slow most times. If I could find a better and easier app for something like this, I’d
                                uninstall this one in a heartbeat. Business wise I can’t speak my opinion on it if
                                you’re specifically using it for that. I’m assuming if you upgrade to the “higher”
                                packages you may have a better experience, I have no idea but I personally don’t like
                                OneDrive at all.</p>

                                programs need will be lost. The 2 reasons I have seen: (1) when it moved a documents
                                folder to online, it ran out of storage space. Only two of 5 subfolders were available
                                online. Excel could not find the documents that were moved to a Temporary One Drive
                                folder on my C:drive. Even as my computers Administrator, I was not allowed access to
                                the documents! (2). Third party applications like Ultrafractal, Photofusion, Photoshop,
                                Illustrator, ...etc. could not locate saved files or templates or albums! Trying to
                                uninstall One Drive was a big mistake since they changed User permissions! The One Drive
                                support team helped me recover my lost files and I can now recreate artwork, correct
                                photographs, find formulas in my excel worksheets...etc. However, One Drive’s file
                                relocations continue to haunt me as I discover other programs that are no longer linked
                                to originating software. On a side note, now that France is taxing online service
                                providers, maybe someone at Microsoft will see online service as the new source of
                                income for local, state and federal that, no doubt, legislators will never give up
                                trying to get their fair share of.</p>
