                                Laura and Delta back-to-back in Aug. 2020. Laura was a Category 4 with sustained winds
                                of 175mph. Delta dropped 17 inches of rain in 4 hours. The damage to my home and the
                                City was extensive. I was shocked and devasted by the damage because I had just retired
                                as the result of a complex hip fracture. I was on crutches and dealing with severe pain.

                                wallet to the extreme.</p>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I called DROPBOX Support and explained my situation and
                                indicated I needed to end the subscription. The SUPPORT TEAM was very nice and
                                supportive. They downgraded me to the free version.</p>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I remember that experience with gratitude. And I thank the

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I’ve been using the Dropbox text editor for years. It seems
                                after the last few updates the text editor is very buggy. 1) I when I save, it says I
                                have a new version. So I have to reload the file. 2) When I select edit, sometimes the
                                file opens with the cursor at the top, sometimes the file opens with the cursor at the
                                bottom, sometimes the cursor jumps around randomly. The point is, when I click edit, I
                                want to edit where my cursor is. When the file jumps around, I lose my context, and have
                                to scroll up and down to find what I wanted to edit. 3) sometimes I type and nothing
                                appears. I can actually see the cursor in another part of the text, I can type letters,
                                but nothing shows up. At this point, I have to close the editor and open it again to
                                clear it up. 4) sometimes I try to select text, the selection doesn’t align over the
                                actual text. It seems to be out of sync with the position of the text. 5) sometimes when
                                I select text the selection jumps to the right side of the screen even if there’s no
                                text there. It won’t allow me to adjust the selection.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Clearly, no one at dropbox actually uses to text editor or
                                they would run into the same problems. Also, they must not have test cases. To run
                                through every time they make changes. This is simple regression testing.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I really love the app and it gives me the ability to share my
                                files between my iPad and my desktop computer easily. I originially got Dropbox because
                                Google Drive was draining my battery by constantly running in the background. Well, my
                                battery has been draining again over time by almost 30% or more at times. I checked my
                                battery usage and Dropbox was running in the background for 7 hours straight. Why? I
                                looked up the issue, and someone mentioned the only way to fix it was to disable it in
                                the File app on my device, but I don’t want to do that, because sometimes I do need to
                                access things from that app, or move things that way. I understand that it checks the
                                folder in Files and makes sure everything is synced to the actual Dropbox app, but 7
                                hours? There’s also an issue where if I upload items to Dropbox within the app, if I
                                close the app, it stops uploading. I have to have the app open for it to finish
                                uploading. I’ve never had to deal with that before. Not sure if these are Apple issues
                                or Dropbox issues. I hope there’s another fix for it though, because I shouldn’t be
                                going to sleep with my iPad at 100% and waking up to it already down to 70%. I guess I
                                will do the temporary fix in files for now, unless I find another cloud service that
                                doesn’t drain my battery all day.</p>

                                services were already doing all of this? Did you not already have cloud based service
                                through your smart phone brand or google? Why accept yet another app that is cloud based

                                or “doccushare3000”! I’m sure there is some feature that is unique to Dropbox that has

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Unfortunately, I find myself fighting with the program all
                                the time. When upgrades are made, I find there is a glitch of some sort. Once I was
                                notified I needed to backup my files. In the process of doing this, I lost them all. 3
                                years worth of data! There were no directions for backing up. There was no access on how
                                to recover from old backups anywhere. These things should be clearly outlined in a
                                manual, if there is one. The other thing I hate is that if you transfer files in or out
                                of Dropbox, you have to do it one file at a time. You can’t transfer multiple files or a
                                folder of files to Dropbox. Also you can no longer get to things like print or move a
                                file to editing program (Word) without first clicking on “share” to find those options.
                                Why the need to double click for these options? Other options are available with a
                                single click but I don’t use those things. Ok, I have more but will stop now. I do like
                                the program and still use it. Not so much on my phone due to the above complaints. Just
                                wanted to let others know what life is like using the program.</p>

                                least I thought I was. I’m not trying to get sympathy. I’m just frustrated with all of
                                this. I’m I am so frustrated with Dropbox. I’m gonna try to get my stuff out and do
                                something out to back my files up. I had to upgrade professional so I can try to speak
                                to somebody but again they said you can’t talk to nobody until you get enterprise. They
                                added security to my dropbox that I didn’t ask for. I should be the one to adjust the
                                security on my own folder I pay enough for it. Now I get a two-step verification on the
                                phone that never existed and an email that is inaccessible and I can’t get nobody at
                                Dropbox to help. I have 3 TB of information that I have saved up over 30 years and now I
                                can’t access it so I’m trying to go through back doors. And I’m so upset with Dropbox
                                I’ve done feedback, tickets and everything dropbox. You can go stick it. I’m so fed up
                                with you. This is not a way to run a company. it appears I’m not the only one that feels
                                this way. I’ve been to several message boards to try to find help to get my stuff back
                                but I can’t so I guess I’ll just wipe the sleep clean and go somewhere else and just
                                live on an island. Thanks a lot Dropbox.</p>

                                to get a hold of tech-support at Dropbox, I have to do it. I upload documents to a
                                service and once that Service receives the documents they send me an email I then open
                                up that email click on the link and download the documents that I uploaded. These
                                documents are proof that I uploaded them to that service. I then download those
                                documents through a web browser on my iPad and then save them to dropbox as a PDF. Since
                                the last update to iOS to 17.3, when I go to upload the document to dropbox from Safari
                                browser, I get a message stating that there is no Internet. This means I cannot upload
                                the document to dropbox through Safari browser. I can do it to any other online cloud
                                service just not to dropbox. I can upload from anywhere else on my iPad to dropbox just
                                not from Safari. Apple said that this is a dropbox problem not their problem since it
                                seems to only happen when uploading the dropbox. Since I can’t get a hold of anybody at
                                tech-support to talk about this, they will not know they have a problem. Hopefully
                                somebody at dropbox will read this. Fix the problem.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I’ve used Dropbox for years with no issues, although it is
                                overpriced and their peculiar insistence on landing you on “Recents” rather than “My
                                Files” is annoying. However, if you must purchase Dropbox, do it on their site and not
                                via the App Store. Here’s why: They sent me a note saying my payment method (Apple) was
                                invalid and I had to “update” my payment method with Apple or lose my paid features on
                                May 31st. Spoke with tech support via chat and confirmed that my payment info is up to
                                date, and that it has successfully gone through for ApplePay, dozens of other apps, and
                                a couple of streaming services. He escalated me to someone who days later sent me a
                                boilerplate email that showed he hadn’t read anything from the previous conversation. I
                                replied, explaining again. No answer. I wrote back asking for an ETA on a response, as
                                May 31 was fast approaching. No answer. Then on May *29* — two days before the supposed
                                deadline — I got an email saying “Your account has been downgraded.” Finally managed to
                                resubscribe by severing my payment within Apple and purchasing on their site (although
                                now I wish I hadn’t). And *still* no response from customer service.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Please note however, that in these cases, Dropbox cannot know
                                what the issue on the payment may be, as it is processed by Apple. This is the reason
                                why we suggest reaching out to Apple Support first, in such cases.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I depend on Dropbox for my personal and Business data back up
                                and I have an iPhone 11 with all of the latest iOS and software, however the dropbox app
                                from the AppStore will not upload my photos! Even when I’m on a Wi-Fi connection at 50+
                                Mbps upload speeds, it is not enough for me to get my photos and videos uploaded which
                                is a bug in the app surely. If I literally watch it upload, it is so slow that it takes
                                minutes for a simple photo to upload and if I walk away from my phone (even with the
                                screen on) it just stops uploading and is on the same file/photo when I come back to it,
                                sometimes up to an hour later. It’s like when my phone is sitting still it won’t upload
                                photos, which I’m sure is some sort of a bug with this app that is tied to some sort of
                                sensor on my iphone. Something that needs to be investigated and resolved because given
                                that I have the dropbox business enterprise premium plan I should be able to upload
                                photos or someone should respond to my support tickets and help me resolve this issue
                                which I have recorded exactly as I’ve stated on video. And I've never had a reply for
                                support beyond an initial email.</p>

                                me to the App Store I go to the App Store and it says that it's updated and it has a

                                updating has also stopped working so my phone has had to stay on for a week without

                                of course it doesn't help that apple's new update that was just shipped refuses to
                                install even though it's already downloaded so I need to get everything synced so I can
                                back up and do it on the computer. Yes my perfectly good phone got ridiculously slow
                                "after I got notified"!!!! and the notification crashes and settings, update crashs. Oh
                                and if there was an DB update it wouldn't tell me what was updated because that would be
