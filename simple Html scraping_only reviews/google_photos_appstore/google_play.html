                                at best! I must own millions of photos! And I’ve probably over the years lost thousands
                                I’ll never get back from having stored them on the hard drives of computers that died
                                and took my photos with them to their graves! Precious memories I’ll never get back! So
                                when my Son hooked me up with the Googles Photo App and walked me through it I’ve found
                                it to be basically THE BEST way of storing and accessing my photos PLUS being able to
                                automatically share ones I want to directly from the app itself! No more of this having
                                to go into my photos and selecting the ones I want to share; then having to drag-n-drop
                                them into another app or my email so I can send them! Also as I understand it, I no
                                longer have the worry issue of “what if my computer crashes or just dies and I lose all
                                my pictures—a-g-a-i-n!” Now with them being stored in Google Photos, I’ll always have
                                them at the ready so I can get to them from any device anytime and anywhere I go! I have
                                to say I’m loving this concept and I’m really enjoying this service! It’s truly
                                unbelievable how much freedom from worrying and stress it has given me. And really;
                                couldn’t We ALL use a little less worry and stress in our days? I know I could and
                                thanks to the Google Photo App one less worry and stressor has been eliminated from my
                                world! THANK YOU GOOGLE PHOTOS! Keep up the Great work!!!</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I used to recommend to EVERYONE to get and use Google Photos
                                because automatically across all devices you can have ALL your photos in one place and
                                you can free up the massive amount of space they take up on said devices. Plus the
                                little Memories and fun little albums and things they make are cute especially when they
                                do it all for you. The only problem is now the storage issue not very long after they
                                started making you pay for storage after 15gb I surpassed 15gb. It would be nice if my
                                email wasn’t also part of what makes up the amount stored. Now I either have to clean
                                house which is why I got this app to begin with space and the work to maintain space
                                somewhere being a burden. Or pay. And I just hate paying for apps and hate paying for
                                stuff that was once free and also hate paying because I’m basically being forced to pay.
                                Separating my emails (the thousands on my account since I’ve had gmail for yrs and yrs)
                                from the allotment of space for my photos I think would be a good alternative to
                                consider. That way it’s 15gb free solely for photos and after that pay. But with
                                everyone and their mother sister aunt cousin and all their third party blah blah blah
                                emailing me 3x a day like come on. I’m seriously considering not even keeping a Gmail
                                any more Because of this space issue but again SOO MUCH WORK. I want big tech to make my
                                life simpler not more complicated and aggravating. But if space or paying isn’t an issue
                                then 100% recommend 😁</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">It was honestly too good to be true when they offered
                                unlimited photo storage. Sadly that came to an end. When it was unlimited storage, I
                                literally made it a point to bring up in conversation to every single one of my friends.
                                Funny enough, nobody believed me when I explained how good it was, and they missed out
                                if they didn’t download it. The longer you put off downloading this app, the more you
                                will miss out on. This app was everything (and more) before any other game company was
                                doing anything remotely similar. And I’m confident everything uploaded won’t be hacked
                                or leaked. If you are a criminal or take photos of yourself commuting a crime, maybe
                                don’t do that, but also I would suggest not using this service just in case. The
                                government can subpoena your Google data and although I haven’t ever seen Google Photos
                                being a turning point for a case, I don’t doubt that the government could make Google
                                give them access to every single photo you’ve every taken. But that’s one end of the
                                double edge sword - the other end is that every single photo you ever take will be
                                automatically uploaded to the servers so you don’t have to do it yourself and so you
                                never have to worry that any of your photos will ever be lost. But, now you have to pay
                                for storage so that is on you for not using this app sooner. I use this app more than
                                the photos app on iPhone.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Pretty solid app. Downloaded it because Apple iCloud got full
                                and had less space plus I’m able to use this on any phone unlike Apple photo app I can
                                download google photos on any device and have all my photos no matter if I break a phone
                                or get a new one I’ll always have my pictures. Google photos app also has some really
                                cool features on it. I love that every time you open the app it downloads all new photos
                                you’ve taken sense the last time you opened the app and not only that but it also works
                                in the background if you don’t cancle the app out so you can literally click on the app
                                and go onto Facebook and your photos will still upload. And it also has a feature to
                                where the app asks you if you want to delete the photos on your phone that are in the
                                google photos cloud so you can free up space on your phone which saves so much storage.
                                And not to mention that you have so much space for a ton of photos and videos (and when
                                I say a ton I mean it, bcuz I normally have any where from 1,000 to 5,000 photos on my
                                phones. I’ve had 5 phones over time that are/ were linked with the google photos cloud
                                app so that’s somewhere between 20,000 photos and I still have a lot of space left for
                                20,000 more. 10/10 stars. My only complain is I Just wished it worked better for offline

                                with other accounts and practically and literally never had any unsolved problems, if I
                                had any problems or frustrations with Google Photos which is “none”, and my files has
                                always been saved in the mode you have set, especially PNG files with transparent
                                background I use for digital art and photoshopping I do, which Apple iCloud mess up all
                                the time, they don’t keep PNG files the way they are supposed to keep, without
                                background for vectors, etc., they give them a white background to those PNG files
                                without background and it’s very inconvenient and frustrating, in the two years of first
                                time use of Apple Devices and iCloud, I got to a point of not wanting to use iCloud or
                                any Apple devices anymore for good, on the other hand, Google Photos has been excellent
                                and simple in the picture storage and has worked almost flawlessly ever since I started
                                using its services. I am very happy with Google Photos as my trust in them with my files
                                can’t be beat by any other cloud storage.</p>

                                and unique feature of Google Photos are the ‘Photo Stories’ and ‘Movies’ they compile
                                for you out of your gallery of pictures! Sometimes they even include
                                subject-matter-appropriate background music and include dates, times, places, and titles
                                describing the theme of the slideshow or collage of photos which range anywhere from
                                deeply personal and heartfelt renderings to silly, awesome, one-of-a-kind gifs you can
                                save and use later! You can even easily purchase one -or all!- of these creations for a
                                tangible hard copy if you want! There are literally so many more amazing features to
                                this app that I can’t even name them all without writing a few more paragraphs lol! So,
                                I hope this honest, personal opinion will serve as a good enough review for those of you
                                who have yet to partake in the effortlessness that is Google Photos. 😘🤗✌🏽</p>

                                pretty adequate for my needs. It would be nice to know I was storing the original
                                quality but I don’t need another monthly bill besides Google Drive. It’s awesome the way
                                they rotate some of the photos for you or give you that option. I wish they would do
                                more in terms of the facial recognition so that you can correctly date some of your
                                photographs were the dates were stripped in the uploading process which for me was a bit
                                of a hellish experience because it crashed while uploading. I got past all that and
                                everything I own is in my Google library I just don’t have them sorted properly. I’m
                                hoping this will be done automatically in the future using the facial recognition
                                technology otherwise I have to spend years fixing my library.</p>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Another suggestion would be if they would show you your
                                duplicates which are close to exact duplicates so that you can delete them on your own.
                                Sometimes it appears to be refusing duplicates but it’s hard to tell exactly what Google
                                is doing behind the scenes occasionally I’ll see a duplicate missing other times I find
                                odd photos in my trash. It would be nice to know exactly what’s happening with them
                                folders. Those are all my suggestions and why I don’t have five stars I appreciate the
                                free storage in the meantime hoping I won’t have to go with higher quality photos in the
                                future.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Update: 6 April 2024. This app is easy to use and still beats
                                Apple photo app as to search term intelligence and retrieval. And it’s editing abilities
                                are impressive as well. However Google coulda/shoulda included a photo duplicate search,
                                select and delete function because it still seems that somehow some of my photos get
                                duplicated! Google has the best mathematicians, ai experts/analysts and programmers in
                                the world. Every computer or smartphone user and device depends one way or another on
                                Google services. Given all Google’s talent and Google’s vast user base, Google
                                should/coulda fitted Google Photo with an outstanding Photo Duplicate Deletion by now! A
                                photo duplicate search/select and delete feature could make Google Photos the ultimate
                                photo storage and managing app with this one addition Google Photo Duplicate Deleter
                                should include these features: 1) Intelligence to detect 4 classes of duplicates: exact
                                dupes, nearly exact dupes, similar dupes and No Duplicates Exist photo. 2) Allow users
                                to review and select photos within these groups pic by pic. 3) Allow users to delete
                                either one photo dupe at a time or by “all pics selected.” 4) Create 2 kinds of delete
                                destinations: a) TRASH and a b) HOLD 20 DAYS Before Deletion file. So yes Google Photos
                                is very smart and very much appreciated but it isn’t yet perfect!</p>
