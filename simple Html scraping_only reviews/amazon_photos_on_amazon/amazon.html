                                <span>****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***<br><br>Hmm...not quite sure
                                    what to say about this "new" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful
                                    prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it
                                    worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've
                                    heard a lot about "other" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not
                                    going to happen to Azon. I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At
                                    least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if
                                    a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I
                                    had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it
                                    pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is
                                    gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. "Resistance is futile". And then along comes
                                    THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has
                                    an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has Azon in front of it. It wasn't
                                    pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND
                                    NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running
                                    WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read
                                    this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and
                                    physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you
                                    not...SHLOOP!<br><br>Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your
                                    pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY
                                    picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to,
                                    can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to
                                    much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.<br><br>So, do I like
                                    it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a
                                    hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!
                                    Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is
                                    leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.<br>***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED
                                    MORE STARS!<br> Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's
                                    "hover parenting" style of running their business. But due to some recent events
                                    that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid
                                    NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam,
                                    smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no
                                    names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines.
                                    Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY
                                    careful, you can still be...umm..."inconvenienced" let's say, by someone trying to
                                    squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me
                                    say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And
                                    (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments
                                    too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS
                                    NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions
                                    anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had
                                    found its way into my phone via "sticky notices". It got so bad that I would not
                                    sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that
                                    were looking for a couch to crash on! I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon
                                    App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought
                                    fiercely! "UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"
                                    When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My
                                    ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps
                                    on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon
                                    is awake...and watching..<br> To all you evil creatures, beware!</span>

                                <span>We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to
                                    learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually
                                    quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb
                                    drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon
                                    because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with
                                    it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my
                                    android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a
                                    charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we
                                    need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!</span>

                                <span>What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many
                                    thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many
                                    photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that
                                    requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and
                                    directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE
                                    benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg
                                    elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but
                                    you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love
                                    that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon
                                    Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to
                                    Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only
                                    copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at
                                    risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know.
                                    I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any
                                    other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to
                                    utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!</span>

                                <span>Since Amazon began offering free unlimited photo storage for prime members, I've
                                    been backing up all my pics from various computers and from archive drives to the
                                    Amazon Cloud.<br><br>WHAT I LIKE ...<br><br>* the price, free for Amazon prime
                                    customers<br><br>* pictures are saved at their full size (unlike the free storage on
                                    Google Drive)<br><br>* relatively easy to use<br><br>* deleted photos remain online
                                    in a deleted folder, so that they can later be restored if necessary. There is also
                                    a "permanently delete" option.<br><br>* ability to view photos in chronological
                                    order. While traveling, I typically will take photos on my iphone, my tablet, a SLR
                                    camera and a pocket camera. Amazon stores just enough metadata to be able to offer
                                    you the option of displaying photos chronologically. So, upon returning from a trip,
                                    I can upload all the various devices separately and still view the pics in
                                    chronological order, without having to first combine the photos from different
                                    devices into a single folder.<br><br>and the most significant benefit for
                                    me:<br><br>* my entire photo library is now available for viewing from all my
                                    portable devices! Additionally, the cache utilization can be set so that recently
                                    displayed photos remain viewable even without wi-fi access.<br><br>.<br>WHAT I
                                    DISLIKE ...<br><br>* time to upload. At the 15 mps speed in my home, I get just over
                                    100 photos an hour uploaded.<br><br>* lack of any way to organize uploaded files.
                                    Photos can't be moved between folders nor can folders be renamed. And unless you
                                    want to have multiple directories labeled "101Canon," you should name your
                                    directories before you start to upload. The same goes for any file names.<br><br>*
                                    while uploading, the software does not display the names of the files being sent or
                                    of those folders in the queue, only the total number of photos queued and the number
                                    already transferred.<br><br>* the need to pull any video files out of the folders
                                    before uploading. Video storage on Amazon is not free (beyond your initial free 10
                                    GB) and, more importantly, those larger video files take FOREVER to upload.<br><br>*
                                    poor photo editing capabilities. If you'd like to do any editing beyond the basic
                                    crop or contrast, I'd suggest you do it elsewhere, before you upload.<br><br>*
                                    limited metadata displayed. You get file name, date taken, date added, file size and
                                    image size. Photos are organized by album and can be sorted, either within an album
                                    or globally, by either date taken or date uploaded. (I am hoping that Amazon has
                                    actually stored all the metadata in the photos I've uploaded and, with enough
                                    suggestions to do so, will begin to display all of it.)<br><br>* occasional
                                    uploading issues. 1) If the uploader discovers that a photo being sent has the same
                                    name as one already in the target directory, it will stop and await user input
                                    before continuing, which sometimes makes it hard to just walk away during the
                                    process. 2) an occasion photo will not upload; in these instances, the uploader
                                    continues and provides an error message with the photo name. 3) on a couple of
                                    occasions, uploading has stopped without explanation beyond a simple error message.
                                    In those cases, I've had to open the directory on the Cloud drive, determine what
                                    picture in what folder was the last to upload and then upload that directory again,
                                    making sure to first remove those photos from the directory that have already been
                                    transferred.<br><br>* occasional duplicates. If you happen to have the same image
                                    stored on multiple devices and you upload the image from each device you'll wind up
                                    with two copies of the same photo on the cloud (assuming each is coming from a
                                    folder with a different name).<br><br>.<br>Given these limitations, here's the
                                    process I've been following with any new photos:<br><br>1) Download the photos to my
                                    PC<br>2) Delete and/or edit photos on the PC, using Picasa or any other
                                    full-featured photo editor<br>3) Save the remaining photos in a folder with a
                                    descriptive name<br>4) Upload that folder to the Amazon Cloud, usually overnight.
                                    For now, I've been keeping the original directory on my PC, as an additional
                                    backup.<br><br>Despite a few shortcomings, I view photo backup on the Amazon Cloud
                                    as a no-brainer, especially for Amazon Prime customers. Unlimited free storage of
                                    full-size photos is a deal that can't be beat. No more worry about keeping multiple
                                    backups at separate locations. I've already lost one set of family photos to a
                                    failed HDD and don't intend to lose another.</span>

                                <span>As long as you're sure you want to pay for prime year after year, it's a wonderful
                                    way to store photos for "free". I mean, it's hardly a deciding factor for purchasing
                                    prime, but it's a really fabulous extra medium for backing up photos. I wouldn't use
                                    it as my primary storage; some form of physical storage medium it's definitely going
                                    to be 1000x better than any cloud storage tool. Still, though, this is a great way
                                    to have access to your pictures/video while keeping your phone lean,
                                    storage-wise.</span>

                                <span>I have had Amazon photos since 2017. No problems until a few days ago when I tried
                                    to access my account in the app kept kicking me out. Couldn't figure what the
                                    problem was until I went into manage account. It stated my account had been locked.
                                    Upon further research online I found thousands of people on Reddit and other social
                                    media platforms that have had the same issue with amazon. Mysterious blocking of
                                    their Amazon photo account and all of them have done the same thing that I haven't
                                    received the same form letter answers that I have. Contact customer service, give
                                    them your information pertinent to the problem, told my customer service you will
                                    hear from tech support in 24 to 48 hours, no email is received and no messages sent
                                    from Amazon, free contact customer support given same response yet again and a case
                                    number. Still no response.<br>This is been going on and on for years with different
                                    people with the same issue. Amazon is fine to let you continue shopping but you
                                    can't access the hundreds of thousands of photographs that they now hold hostage. So
                                    my advice to you keep your money find a subsidiary app that allows you to make
                                    Prince of your photographs in order through them. I recommend Walmart. Amazon simply
                                    doesn't care anymore. Don't believe me do the research yourself.
                                    Below:<br><br>Amazon photo drive locked<br><br>Amazon photo account
                                    locked<br><br>Those two should get you started. But everybody has been receiving the
                                    exact same responses with no outcome.</span>

                                <span>I’ve used several different apps to store my photos and videos in the cloud, with
                                    varying degrees of success. I decided to give “Prime Photos from Amazon” a spin, to
                                    see if it offers any advantages over the other cloud photo storage apps I’ve used in
                                    the past…<br><br>In two words: it doesn’t. It does essentially everything that the
                                    other apps do, only not as well. It was very slow to upload the 1,300 photos I have
                                    on my phone – it took nearly four hours to upload them from my Galaxy S7. “Prime
                                    Photos from Amazon” offers a basic set of tools for organizing photos into “People,”
                                    “Places,” and “Things,” but not much else. I can keep my photos for private viewing,
                                    or I can share them with others.<br><br>“Prime Photos from Amazon” also offers a
                                    useful set of photo editing tools, which can be used for adjusting color,
                                    brightness, and contrast; adding frames and text; and creating memes.<br><br>One
                                    feature of “Prime Photos from Amazon” I find very frustrating. When it first
                                    uploaded my photos, it captured images of different people’s faces from group photos
                                    and set them aside in a section called “People.” Many of these images are of people
                                    I don’t know, and many are too blurry or grainy to use. Yet, the app provides me
                                    with no way to edit or delete those individual “People” images that I don’t want.
                                    All I can do is delete the entire photo from which these “People” images are drawn,
                                    and that is unacceptable to me.<br><br>“Prime Photos from Amazon” was released in
                                    April 2017. Because it is so new, I get the feeling it is still a work in progress.
                                    It has a lot of potential to become a truly outstanding cloud photo storage and
                                    editing app – but it’s not there yet. Right now, it’s strictly average fare.
                                    Recommended (for now) only as a backup for other, better apps of the same
                                    type.</span>

                                <span>I absolutely love how it is UNLIMITED for pictures (can't/hard to find that
                                    anywhere else!) And it's pretty cool that it has the corresponding phone app to
                                    backup your photos automatically too. It is really nice to have peace of mind that
                                    my precious memories will be safe in a cloud if anything happens to the hard
                                    copies...all of this is good for Amazon and as a retention strategy because now I
                                    don't think I can ever pass/cancel my Prime membership lest I lose this very
                                    advantageous service/method...<br><br>5GB for videos is a bit restrictive though...I
                                    mean, I understand how much space it could potentially take, but memories are easily
                                    on videos as they can be/are on photos...and $60 for unlimited videos (as well as
                                    other files) is STEEP...hard to justify...I mean, how about a $10-$15 3-month
                                    subscription versus a single option of a full $60 for the year (no in-between
                                    option)...<br><br>And for pictures (in the Photos &amp; Videos section) to be only
                                    sorted by "date taken" and "date uploaded" is also rather limited as well. Sometimes
                                    dates on camera's are wrong or never set up, or people upload in bulk (like I am);
                                    makes sorting when the files were uploaded all come up in the same section anyways.
                                    Would be nice to have sorted by folder, name, exposure (maybe?), device (camera),
                                    dimensions, location (if geo-tagged), size, tags, even color!, etc...<br><br>Also, I
                                    wish that the program (on PC) didn't only upload only 4 files at a time...If a user
                                    has enough bandwidth, the program should allow for the max possible...Also, it would
                                    be nice to be able to skip certain (big) files and/or only/filter upload by file
                                    type or something...<br><br>TL;DR -- This is an amazing service/option (if you have
                                    Prime membership) to have. Nothing I listed are "deal breakers," but it shows that
                                    there is still a little bit left to be desired; though that will not stop me from
                                    fully using this service.<br><br>UPDATE (8/1/17): So Amazon has done much with Prime
                                    Photos since I wrote my review. I believe Prime Photos was rather in its infancy at
                                    the time of writing. And as I see some people are still reading this review, I
                                    decided it'd be good to put in an update to show what's different/better and/or my
                                    opinion on matters.<br><br>So, since then, it looks like Amazon has inputted more
                                    than just the 2 choice of either free but limited (5GB) or unlimited but expensive
                                    ($60 at the time). Apparently, it's a free 5 GB, $12 for 100 GB, $60 for 1 TB
                                    (still), and $120 for 30 TB. I still really believe doing a very cheap 3 month type
                                    subscription than a yearly one (broken down = $1/month for 100 GB total). I'm
                                    betting people are not so willing to commit to a whole year subscription and not be
                                    able to back out within the year or is forced to wait til the year is over to
                                    cancel.<br>It is nice that you can now sort and filter by objects in the collection
                                    of pictures (i.e. dog, cat, lamp, drinks, cup, party, etc.). Still, I think it would
                                    be nice to add the option of sorting by camera, dimension, size, and even color! If
                                    it were to include those, I think it would be really helpful because in a collection
                                    reaching 5 to 6 figures, those can really narrow down if I was trying to seek
                                    certain ones.<br>But I absolutely LOVE the facial recognition and sorting by face! I
                                    know it's done in other photo archiving/backup services, but it's still really nice
                                    to see it implemented here. It's still doesn't run perfectly (keeps re-arranging,
                                    keeps dropping ID after reconfiguring/rearranging, assigning myriad babies and older
                                    asian ladies bulked together, etc.), but when it does hit, it makes for a nice and
                                    curious feature.<br>It still hasn't really made it capable of uploading more than 4
                                    files, nor the capability to upload only picture or document or other type files (it
                                    would upload a 1.4GB video, reaching the max 5GB, and then skipping all other
                                    documents, .pdf's, and scans). These are sorely missing out.<br>It is nice to have
                                    it automatically "syncing" with the Amazon folder on my computer. I just put my
                                    pictures and picture folders in there, and they automatically upload and backup to
                                    the Amazon Drive and available in Prime Photos. Keeps it simple, easy, and rather
                                    mindless to keep from worrying about another thing...<br><br>Still, in the end, this
                                    is a wonderful, GREAT service to have considering it's no more additional $ to have
                                    with your PRIME membership. And just as before, none of these are "deal-breakers"
                                    again, just that there are still things left to be desired. But I can't think of any
                                    reason why this isn't anything but beneficial to PRIME members!</span>

                                <span>First to the people that say they were charged or that it doesnt work on your
                                    kindle fire or any other issues how about you try to fix it your self first. The app
                                    is after all for FREE Amazon didnt have to create a cloud app, but they did. You
                                    really think they would create an app thag doesnt work on their own product?! If
                                    uninstalling and reinstalling doesnt work them do some work on search engines or
                                    Amazons help files for options or alternatives.<br><br>They would not make a new
                                    product that wouldn't work on the Kindle Fire's that would be logically stupid on so
                                    many tech and business levels. If I can run this app on a old Samsung Galaxy Epic
                                    1st gen phone then you can most certainly run it on you up to date kindle or tablet.
                                    My table (if your curious) isnt a Kindle but my friends is. My tablet is Samsung
                                    Galaxy Tab 2.0.<br><br>This app is obviously VERY new and with any type of software,
                                    or new pc, new tablet, new anything in the electronic world there are going to be
                                    little issues and updates will ALWAYS follow. Just be patient.<br><br>This app is
                                    set up right now for PHOTOS ONLY I am sure this will change. For those that have any
                                    brain cells working YES this is all connected to the cloud drive period. If you go
                                    to Amazons website or help section it clear describes two services, one for
                                    music/mp3 that is free up to a limit or you can then purchase a annual subscription
                                    for tons of more space to store your entire music collection. Then there is The
                                    Cloud. This is for ALL files from photos, documents, etc. The app sadly only handles
                                    photos and syncing which is great, but if your paying for a service then you want it
                                    to naturally have more and include the ability to conduct the files too. This is all
                                    new so I hope to see updates in the future. (Side note, someone said there is
                                    another amazon cloud app for everything else, there isnt as far as I can tell, I
                                    checked.)<br><br>For those that say other competetors are cheaper, review your math
                                    skills. I did a price comparison chart to compare which is the better buy,
                                    especially to huge rivals like the big G, and guess what??? The price is about the
                                    same! When you break it down per dollar per Gigabyte the amounts the SAME. The major
                                    difference is payment, Amazon only does annually, the big G does ONLY monthly, they
                                    have no billing method set up yet for anual payments. They said they would add this
                                    in later/soon.<br><br>OVERALL..if you are already using Amazon services to buy
                                    things, to get books (its original source of popularity), or music (they have better
                                    rates and specials on music than that piece of fruit named product), then this
                                    should be added to your collection. It will make things easier and prevent you from
                                    loosing your photos on that precious device if it should ever experience a firey or
                                    watery pit o'doom.</span>

    <span>As a heavy fire tv stick user, this app has become indispensable, especially since I'm using the feature to select a photo album as a screensaver.  On my PC, tablet or phone, I can merely upload a photo through SHARE, and then selectively add it to the album I want, all organized for me.<br><br>My big screen TVs have slideshows running with music playlists running.  (It's not integrated but if you start your playlist in MUSIC, press pause, go HOME and start PHOTOS, when you press PLAY, both the music and the slideshow play at once.<br><br>There is time for improvement.<br><br>1. SLOW setting on the slideshow is still too fast for my taste. I'd love AT LEAST to have a very slow option and preferably the ability to set custom time between photos from not only a specific set of seconds but also to minutes.<br><br>2. Amazon Music should be integrated, so you can run music behind your slideshows<br><br>3. PHOTOS currently requires you upload a photo to their platform, and then separately you have to go into the album and "add" it.  (And you can't touch this on the Fire Stick ver, having to do it on your PC or PDA.  Like Google Drive, we should be able to select the album where we want it to go art the time of uploading, rather than having to do it in 2 separate steps.<br><br>4. An android slideshow widget would be helpful for tablets, especially older tablets we want to turn into picture frames.</span>

    <span>I think it's wonderful that this service is included with Amazon Prime Membership (since the price has increased within the last year or two), it makes it feel like you're getting a lot more than just two-day free shipping with orders.  I think it's fantastic that there's unlimited storage for photos, because as a learning photographer, I have thousands of photos from trips and family.  Now this service gives me additional peace of mind that if my HDD crashes, and I lose my physical backup, that my photos are stored on Amazon's cloud.<br><br>Even though this adds immense value to the Amazon Prime service, I do think that it could be enhanced to make it even better.  I really would like more control over sharing, like being able to group my shared photos into folders (or just being able to share the already-existing folders).  It would also be nice if more RAW formats were supported for online viewing, but I'd be happy with just being able to share specific Albums or Folders from Amazon Cloud on Facebook at a higher resolution than Facebook currently allows.  I have a brand new Sony a7R, and want to be able to show my friends and family the crisp images and all of the fine detail, but Facebook really scales down the resolution, so there's not much difference visibly between my 36MP photos and photos shot with an 13MP smartphone.<br><br>Overall though, I really like the service and I look forward to future improvements.</span>

    <span>If you are concerned about storing and retrieving unlimited amounts of photos and videos across many devices, this may be the application for you. Let's talk about what it doesn't do first: 1) There is no obvious way to search photos or videos based upon key words or facial recognition 2) You cannot edit the photo in the app as you can in Picassa 3)You can't quickly forward or email the photo from the app-- you need to save it on your local device first 4) if the app isn't actively loaded on your device, it obviously isn't going to sync your photos until the app is running.<br><br>What it DOES do is quickly collect all of your photos across any device it is loaded on and arrange thumbnails in either date loaded or date taken order (your choice.) It uploads your pictures and videos to Amazon's cloud device and if you are a Prime member, there is no charge for the storage.  YOu can also upload anything else you like to the 50GB of free space that you are given--so in that way it is like a Google drive.<br><br>I have tried the product on several different platforms-- it runs well on Windows 7, XP, Android and IOS.<br><br>IN summary, a great way to make sure you don't lose any photos --so long as you remember to keep the app logged in!</span>

    <span>I have been concerned about losing my pictures, music, &amp; docs if my hard drive crashed. With the cloud there are no more external drives-no dvds-no more scheduled backups-no more worries. I now have all my pics, music, docs in the cloud which provides storage and backup for all my valuable files.  The cloud also provides the ability to see any of your files at anytime and anywhere on your phone, ipads, fires, laptops, etc as long as you are in a WiFi area  The cloud drive gives you the option of sharing, printing, downloading, copying, moving your files. Some may find the Cloud a little pricey but if you have or know anyone who has lost their pics, music, docs then you know the price ain't that bad.  I wish the load speed to the cloud was faster because if you have any large amount of files then the initial load time will be very long and tedious. For example, 5 GB of video took 5 hours to load while 5 GB of pics took about 10 hrs.  But after the initial load of all your files to the cloud that should not be a problem as you will be adding small sizes of data. Also would be great if the Cloud drive was available on your tv like Amazon Prime movies so you could view your videos &amp; pics on any tv w/ WiFi &amp; Amazon. Because of the slow speed and not being available for tvs I am giving 4 starts instead of 5.</span>

    <span>Uploaded a few Gb of pictures as a test.<br>Site is fairly quick on a decent internet connection, both up and downloading, and browsing.<br>If you take RAW camera pictures with Cameras that are older than a few years, they will not be accepted as images but as Data Files! This means you need to sign up for the unlimited data subscription. However, BIG Tiff and PSD/RAW (Adobe Photoshop files, 50-300Mb ea) are recognized as image files.<br>Other than that, uploading was no problem, but pay attention to the option for destination directory!<br>If you don't, you have to manually move the files to a directory that you create either before or after the transfer.<br><br>Place your files in Directories based on your details you usually search by!<br>Sorting on site is SUPER BASIC, either by: File Name, Date Added/Date Modified or Size.<br>Date Added is useless unless you equate Date Added with Date Created (you'd have to upload images straight from your Camera as you take them.  Otherwise the File Name has to have the Date in it, but still would not sort by Date Created if you have several cameras you use that same day since each camera would have a distinct name.<br>Today each camera created picture (unless scanned) has EXIF data that contains the Date Created/Taken, Camera Name and much more that could be used for more detailed searches like typical computers are capable of.<br><br>Knowing these limitations before you start uploading files helps in setting up a system that allows you to find your pictures again.<br>In time I hope this storage ends up looking more like a simple photo search, sort and retrieval archive rather than the shoe-boxes full of pictures of yesteryear.</span>

But even if I had to pay, I would consider it a bargain.<br> For about $1 per month, you get 100gbs to store videos and unlimited photo storage at original quality. The photos upload and sync quickly and flawlessly.it's pretty much like the Google photos app but it beats google because you can save the photos at original quality for no extra fee...And yes you can run both, Google Photos and Amazon photos at the same time on the  same device. Im using both on my mobile, tablet and two laptops. I havent had any problems and all my devices stayed in sync just as you would expect.<br>Cons? I would like a way to manually organize the main photos board. The app gives a few options like sort by date taken or by date saved. But it would be nice to put the photos in groups the way you want. .....other than that, its a great, smooth running app that is a bargain for the money.</span>

    <span>Facial recognition is not great and the app / service is just lacking in so many ways but since Google started charging, I switched because this service is free with Prime membership. The really good thing is unlimited storage for full size photo files in included as long as you're a prime member, but the included video storage allowance is pretty pitiful. I suppose that's so you'll pay for additional storage, but the service just isn't up to par with others so I'm reserving that possibility for later. They really need to give us the ability to add notes and information for each photo that is searchable especially because the facial recognition is so bad. I really hope they step up their game here, it could be so much better!!</span>

    <span>This app saves me so much time and energy. I back up all my photos to my Amazon cloud drive, and this gives me instant access to my entire photo library on any mobile device. I have thousands of pictures, and any time I want one on my phone or tablet I have to go track it down, upload it in an email, send it, download, etc, but with this I always have every picture anywhere I go.<br><br>The reason for giving four stars is the phone app. When you first launch you are given the option to automatically upload and backup photos taken with your phone. Even if you decline, the app shows your phone's pictures, but has a cloud with a line through it in the bottom corner of the picture. I didn't see an easy way to make them go away, but it is definitely an inconvenience since I take a lot of random photos on my phone that I have no intentions of keeping long term.</span>

    <span>First of all, Kudos to Amazon for allowing Prime members to store unlimited photos.  It's a nice membership benefit, and provides a free (and safe) backup for the photos on our family's computer and cellular phones.<br><br>As for the app itself - it does send photos to Amazon's "free" (with prime membership) cloud storage.  And it does a good job of this.  If this is all you want, it's a five star app.<br><br>However, if you're like our family, you've got a file of photos.  The only way to retrieve them is by scrolling through the photos in date order.  And if your photo lacks EXIF data, it is based on the date the photo is uploaded.  Another annoyance?  I've tried deleting a few accidental photos from Amazon from this app several times.  But, even after confirming that, yes, I want to delete these photos from both my phone and Amazon, these photos just keep coming back from the dead!<br><br>If you're looking for a program that will help you organize hundreds of photographs - this program won't do it.  As I've said, you can't even reliably delete photos.  But it's still a good photo backup service.</span>

                                <span>It's nice to know that if you don't already subscribe to Amazon Cloud Drive that
                                    you get 5GB for free with this app. If you are already a Cloud Drive subscriber
                                    there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't add this app.<br><br>It was easy to
                                    install, it is easy to use and (contrary to other reviews I've seen here) it does
                                    keep my folder structure and that means it is easy to find ANY photo!<br><br>The
                                    only slight drawback that I see is that there is no way that I have found to start a
                                    slideshow once you bring up a group of photos. If it had this feature, I would have
                                    given it five stars.<br><br>This is a must have for anyone who either already has
                                    Amazon Cloud Drive or someone who wants to get 5GB of Cloud Drive storage for free.

                                    documents, etc. Uploading file to the cloud is simple, viewing them on the Kindle
                                    Fire. Storing them on the "device" itself is a snap. But, getting setup and started
                                    could use a better tutorial/set of a-to-z instructions, step-by step from setting up
                                    a cloud drive on the PC, populating it, sending them to Amazon Cloud, initially
                                    accessing them on the Kindle, etc. However, in spite of a bit of an awkward time

                                    show the files, photos, videos to friends..I also use the Kindle to store my
                                    pre-flight and landing check list for flight simulation assistance, I use the kindle
                                    as a pilot knee pad then.</span>

                                <span>It was easy to get my photos to upload from my phone. But trying to download
                                    albums back down to my computer and tablet, for use off line is difficult to figure
                                    out. Seems like Prime Photos is set up to be a one-way street, uploading to the
                                    cloud from a phone, but difficult (though not impossible) to download back to a
                                    desktop. It's not a point and click process. It takes multiple steps to "trick it"
                                    into working. Sharing albums via email links is also difficult to learn--but I
                                    figured it out. Browsing YouTube videos only added to my confusion. And I couldn't
                                    find any of the 24/7 tech support promoted on the Amazon promos. Only text pages.
                                    The Unlimited storage capacity is the allure for me, and the fact that it's part of
                                    my Prime package at no extra charge. But transferring files back down to other
                                    devices to use off line was not well thought out (or discouraged?) in the design.
                                    Not intuitive. I assume its probably not profitable, based on the lack of
                                    instructions and lack of obvious download buttons.</span>

                                <span>Having recently switched from my Fire Phone to a LG V10 I lost the immediate,
                                    automatic back up of my photos to my Amazon cloud. This app fixes that problem
                                    simply. It just works and you can set it to upload only on a WiFi connection if you
                                    don't have an unlimited data plan. Plus my photos are instantly available on my Fire
                                    Tablet after they upload from my phone. My only complaint is the fact that you still
                                    can't sort your photos easily into different categories.</span>

                                <span>I really like the app. It's very user friendly, simple to browse through and

                                    notification, more often than I'd like, that says, "cannot connect to prime photos
                                    right now please try again later." That's very frustrating, you can't close it and
                                    open it, or restarting the connection, nothing helps. And by that point I usually
                                    have to leave the Hotspot I was connected to. If they could fix that it would be a 5

                                <span>I use a lot of cloud services, and even more for backup of my photos. They are my
                                    most important data<br>without a doubt. Being a Prime Member I decided why not get
                                    another free backup option. 1TB of free<br>Flickr storage is a lot too. The install
                                    included some default folders, I didn't select them all, just the<br>photos. I may
                                    be missing something, but how do you go back and select them later.<br><br>I have
                                    considered the $60 per year Unlimited Data option. There are numerous more robust
                                    syncing<br>software tools that feature much more granular control. I like the
                                    updated SyncBack Pro, and Allway<br>Sync. I'll see how things go and for $60 it
                                    doesn't hurt to have even more copies of your data,<br>they just need to improve
                                    their tool.<br><br>This goes without saying, but the e-mail today about the change
                                    in syncing to your Music Locker<br>is B.S. If you really want me to load to your
                                    cloud give me a better tool.</span>

                                <span>So happy with this cloud service. I take a lot of photos and seem to have my phone
                                    and camera full all the time. It is crazy just how fast they fill up. I love that I
                                    can store photos here and go through them and make sure I have the correct ones or
                                    best ones at my finger tips at a click of a button. What a great service. I am
                                    thankful that there is a way to back up my photos as I am currently on vacation
                                    outside of my state and it is comforting to know that if something happen to my
                                    phone (which is were i take and store all my photos) I would still have the original
                                    photos and memories stored in the cloud. Very happy and I would recommend this to
                                    anyone.</span>

                                <span>Amazon likes to have people review things a bit early. I only started my prime

                                    have began to upload my files, and so far it's working great. Things are uploading.
                                    Files can be up to 2 Gb, so I only had to edit 5 of my high Def home movies. With my
                                    upload speed, which I believe is pretty good, it's taking about 30 minutes per Gb.

                                    5 stars, but it's early. Let's use it for 6 months before giving a maximum

                                <span>not ready for prime time yet. I love Amazon and I love Amazon Prime so I was
                                    excited to try this out. it was very easy to upload photos from my computer to the
                                    cloud and I have a fast connection so it went quite quickly but when I put them in
                                    the uploader I put them in individual folders and a series of as many as 10 sub
                                    folders. for example there were photos from three different vacations so I created 3
                                    folders each one named with the name of each vacation. with each vacation there were
                                    as many as 10 separate subchapters. however when I look at them on my fire TV it
                                    shows up with 30 different folders and that's it. the hierarchy is gone so I can't
                                    go to the first one and then click down who this subchapter. my sense is Amazon will
                                    figure this out quite quickly and do an update but at the time currently that part
                                    is a little bit weak. also after I uploaded them and I looked at them on the online
                                    viewer I was able to sort them by the name of the date taken and I could cycle
                                    through them in the proper order once again but I tried it on my fire TV they seem
                                    to be playing in reverse order. I think a few tweaks with our software will fix this
                                    and it will be a great service.</span>

                                <span>I read some of the reviews after getting this app. You can make folders on the
                                    Cloud Drive and move photos around to different folders. You can also rename
                                    whatever name is put on an upload. I got this app when I had the original Kindle
                                    Fire, and now I have the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 edition. You don't need the app on it,
                                    except that the only way I've been able to figure out how to upload photos is
                                    through my computer. That works just fine for me. I use the camera on the new Kindle
                                    Fire HD to take a picture, then email it to myself. From my computer I upload it to

                                <span>App isgreat to save space on your phone and to back up pics, but if like me you
                                    have more than just pics on your cloud then this app is not as useful as it could
                                    be. I would love to be able to also store documents on cloud and access them. Also
                                    MP3's instead of having a seperate app for pics and music for the same 5gb storage.
                                    makes little sense. What this ap does it does well, but it could be better if it was
                                    combined with Amazon MP3 and Amazon Kindle. An all in one app for reading, music and
                                    pictures. Hopefully someone will read this and Make it so. I gave 4 stars cuz the
                                    app is great but I wish it could do more.</span>

                                <span>Very solid app, sync up with fire is pretty awesome. Only concern is file
                                    compression. Does anyone know?<br>If I am going to back up my photos in cloud
                                    storage, it infuriates me to think that they are not backed up in the same aspect
                                    ratio and format the original pic, video, screenshot, ect...were shot
                                    in..realistically that means if u delete the original, and the cloud has compressed
                                    the file for maximum storage efficiency, that compromised photo file is the the best

                                    photo backup, more so even than the google photos app during backup and I was
                                    backing up even more photos than I did this time since I have already deleted a lot
                                    off of my phone. I expect some battery drainage, more so than normal usage of the
                                    phone but this was a bit excessive in my opinion.</span>

                                    amazon app and realized I may have SOME PHOTOS in there, but I know I also seen
                                    errors on my old phone that said can’t upload photos no storage but I never paid
                                    attention... OMG GUESSSSS WHAT WAS IN AMAZON PRIME PHOTOS??! Every PHOTO EVER!!!!!!
                                    Thank you so much AMAZON!!!! I’m old and technically challenged so I don’t even know
                                    how you saved all my photos up there in TECH WORLD BUT HANDS DOWN BEST DAY
                                    EVER!!!</span>

                                    automatically upload to the cloud. I take a lot of pictures as I am a art teacher. I
                                    enjoy that my photos are safely and chronological in order. In addition, I have
                                    photos that show up as "on this day, 2015" which my kids love to see old pics of
                                    themselves. I do wish I could edit them or seperate the artwork from my personal
                                    pics. But, overall great app for my peace of mind!😏<br><br>.</span>

                                    Cloud Drive would sign me in to ALL my Amazon apps. I didn't like that idea at all,
                                    so I tapped Sign Out. Now I can't sign in to the Amazon AppStore on my device:
                                    "Login Issue: Please use a valid email and password." Obviously, since I'm posting
                                    this review, I know how to sign in to my Amazon account correctly. So now I can't
                                    access Amazon apps on my device that require AppStore sign-in. But when I try to
                                    sign in to Cloud Drive, I get "We're sorry but we were unable to sign you in. Please
                                    try again later." I've tried signing out of my account through the online browser,
                                    clearing the caches for the AppStore, Cloud Drive and browser apps, then restarting
                                    my device, but that didn't help. Will now try deleting Cloud Drive completely. If
                                    that works, it's staying deleted because it's not worth the hassle.<br><br>Update:
                                    Deleting Cloud Drive didn't fix the problem with AppStore; I had to uninstall and
                                    reinstall it. Haven't had time to check my other Amazon apps but at least now I know
                                    what the fix is (I hope). Cloud Drive stays gone; I can't have this kind of
                                    productivity disruption domino effect all over the place because of one
                                    non-essential app. I hope none of the other Amazon apps follow this course because
                                    I'd hate to give up AppStore, Amazon Local, etc. But I'll pick the one app I deem
                                    most necessary and eliminate the rest if I have to. I don't need all the doors and
                                    windows thrown wide open just because I open one. There are enough stability and
                                    security issues for consumers as it is.</span>

                                <span>I have just begun using the Cloud Drive to store my photos. So far, I have fond it
                                    very easy to do. My biggest problem is the time I am spending looking at all the old
                                    photos before uploading them. Seems I am unable to simply drag and drop, which is
                                    all you have to do. I also have to reminiscence along the way and post old photos to
                                    TBT on Facebook. I especially like the fact that with the Android app.on my phone, I
                                    can view my photos anywhere I go. I also like how easy it is to manage and arrange
                                    the folders after you have uploaded them. Good job Amazon. I am now thinking
                                    seriously of spending the extra $50 or so for the expanded storage in order to
                                    upload all my videos and files.</span>

                            <span>OK after losing pictures off my phone countless of times over the years I'm so
                                grateful to Amazon for pushing me to install this app. Installing this app on all my
                                devices has saved me twice already. It's really cool now to be able to access my entire
                                photo collection at a moments notice, right on my device.<br><br>I've been at family
                                gatherings where I was able to do a slideshow right from phone. It's beautiful to take
                                your mind back in time with your friends, family or loved ones through
                                pictures.<br><br>Just be careful to delete any pictures you take that you don't want
                                saved in the cloud. Otherwise one day that picture will pop up someday on your TV
                                screen... ;-)</span>

                            <span>We've got this app on both our phones and iPads so whenever we take a picture or
                                video, as soon as we're back on wifi, they upload to Amazon cloud. Saves device space
                                and we can browse all the pictures on any device.<br><br>I like the 'memories from this

                                did subscribe to more space to store videos.<br><br>The face recognition is nice to find
                                pictures of specific people, but babies and young kids change too much to reliably
                                categorize them.<br><br>We use this app constantly. Its a wonderful bonus for Prime

                            <span>Well it seems to do as advertised at the moment .upload is terrible though..have to
                                use a 3rd party app to sync to it automatically.....the three stars are for back end so
                                far..I like the web GUI and well the Picture date finder needs some love ....it marked
                                some photos as taken in 2025.....this has all the beginnings of a new app...obvious gaps
                                in functionality...it needs to mature to be a serious cloud offering. You cant just
                                throw up an unlimited storage sign and call it good cus it says Amazon in it..To be
                                honest I think it is dumbed down for the 99% who will have less than a GB to backup and
                                make it profitable....I realize I am capped by my ISP upload speed but there should be
                                better ways of managing it and there seems to be a file size limit...not good...</span>

                                trying to GUESS how this upload is supposed to work.<br>It uploaded my first 'album'
                                with little difficulty but pretty much ignored the other two albums. A check of the
                                'settings' showed the upload had been paused due to no wifi. I find this rather
                                erroneous as my wifi network is function quite efficiently.<br>Also, each time I select
                                the photos I want to upload the software unchecks my selections as soon as I touch save.
                                Is this the way it is supposed to work? I have no clue as there are no directions that I
                                have been able to find. If anyone in the 'know' out there has a clue, please fill me
                                in.<br>I have left my phone plugged in to the charger 24/7 and the second album has
                                finally showed up as uploaded to the Cloud. I am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping
                                the third album will finally show up--but I am not holding my breath!</span>

                            <span>Giving it 2 stars because it does do what it says, but no more. It is lacking features
                                you expect from a modern app.<br>What it does:<br>- Uploads images and videos from your
                                camera to your cloud drive<br><br>What it does not do:<br>- Upload automatically in the
                                background. You have to manually start the app, which means your files won't upload
                                until you remember to start to process. I couldn't find a setting to run in the
                                background like other clients I've used.<br>- Allow you to browse files by folders. You
                                want to look at your pictures? Here they are. All of them. Good luck with that. OK, it

                            <span>I've barely started using this. It seems like it would be great, since I have apple
                                products, an android and a PC and none of the 'speak' to each other! So to be able to
                                upload pictures and have all devices able to access is great! I only give 4 stars, as,
                                it is not explained well on how to use it, how to get it on all devices etc. There also
                                seems to be a similar program out there that saves documents too. Does this do that, as,
                                well??</span>

                            <span>Prime photos is one of the main reason I keep my Prime membership. Along with Prime
                                music. If either of these change from what is included in the membership I would have
                                serious doubt I would renew another year. I seriously use both photos and music all the
                                time. You can automatically have it set to back up your photos when ever you want. I'm
                                worried they night put a restriction or max on the amount of photos saved. But for now
                                it's the best thing ever! Keep up the good work AMAZON PRIME!</span>

                            <span>Every single photo I take on my phone and my husbands phone go stright to prime
                                photos! I love it! Everytime I update my phone I always have to do a reset and I loose
                                everything. But I no longer worry about loosing memories of my boys growing up because
                                they are sent straight to this app. I also love how I can open the app and do a slide
                                show on my fire tv stick when family comes over so they can see how they have been
                                growing!!! I love amazon I am not going to lie I may be an addict!</span>

                            <span>My usual day starts with the This Day sharing of the Prime Photos to my loved ones. It
                                helps bring family and friends even closer. No other photo apps beat this.<br><br>On the
                                other note, people always get confused by the interwoven of Amazon Drive and Prime
                                Photos. It took me a while to figure out whether there is a duplication, isolation, or
                                how to locate the photos in the Drive. Amazon should make it less confusing.</span>

                            <span>We got 5x7's, a photo mug and I believe like a 8x11 or something large like that and
                                they looked perfect! Great dpi on the printing, the paper was nice and solid not
                                translucent on everything other than 4x6's. The 4x6's were grainy and really cheap
                                looking at best but in there defense they only cost $0.09 so you get what you pay for. I
                                would use them again for bigger things just not 4x6's.</span>

                            <span>I really like how easy it is to add photos, especially from my computer. The only
                                reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the app isn't that clear about what picture
                                is on the app or only on the phone. I need to get a new phone &amp; I cannot upload them
                                on a my computer bc it will not recognize my phone. So my only other option is saving it
                                on an app. I really like the Family Vault feature &amp; being able to share.</span>

                            <span>I love that I have this benefit with Prime, but it's been a lot of trouble. When I
                                'select all' and choose 'done' it did not give me any indication that it'd done anything
                                or started a process. It just cleared all of the selections. Miraculously, later on I
                                noticed it was starting to upload my photos, but it was going extremely slowly and not
                                only when I was on wifi. I tend to only download when on wifi so I made the same
                                assumption [that it would save my data usage] if I performed this action on wifi. So I
                                paused the action. And now I don't know how to get back to a place to unpause it; I'm
                                thinking this isn't a choice. So what happens when I try to 'select all' and do it
                                again? Is it going to put duplicates in my drive? I don't know. When I tried to move my
                                photos from my phone to my drive using my laptop it wouldn't let me choose more than one
                                photo to start an upload/queuing process...I'm not going to retroactively upload about
                                2,400 photos by picking them one-by-one. There has to be an easier way! [am I doing it
                                wrong?]</span>

                                message. Buy a couple of storage drives and back up your photos, docs and other valuable
                                records there. No one will have access to them but you and whomever you allow and you
                                don't have to pay $99.00 a year (It was $75.00 a year for Prime when I started. Who
                                knows how much they will increase the cost to in the future.) to store "some" of your
                                precious photos and records. There are many catastrophe resistant backup harddrives on
                                the market these days. They are worth the small investment to secure your precious
                                records while maintaining your privacy.</span>

                            <span>Please be aware that if you have the mobile app and you synch, then delete the
                                pictures off your phone storage it may also be deleted from your mobile app. You need to
                                make sure that the photos are completely synched with the server and not just being
                                "held" by the mobile app. I lost three months of pictures that way. Very uncool! The
                                mobile app should come with a warning that this could happen. I reviewed the pictures in
                                Prime Photos before deleting, so I had already cross-checked. Sad losing pictures of
                                family and grandchildren. And I work in IT so its not user error, I am very "techy".
                                Going back to DropBox but frustrated because I have to pay for this additional service
                                when I should have it through Amazon Prime.</span>

                            <span>So far I'm loving this app and it's so convenient. I live knowing all of the pictures
                                I take from my phone are automatically backed up. I've had trouble in the past with
                                other apps thinking they were backing up my photos when they didn't. I've lost a lot of
                                precious memories. So far I have had no issues with the Amazon Cloud. I would absolutely
                                recommend this to family and friends and I have no reason or intention of not using it
                                in the future.</span>

                            <span>What I find that is so wonderful on Amazon Prime is the Photos. ALL of your photos are
                                stored for you and you do nothing to add them. This helps me when I am taking many
                                pictures at a time or at a party and having too much fun to think about "saving"
                                photos.<br>Amazon Photos comes free with Amazon Prime! Very well worth it.<br>Try it out
                                ... you'll love the convenience!</span>

                            <span>It's great having all your photos in one place. But, I find it very annoying that
                                there is not more space for videos! Videos I take on my phone I would like to have
                                stored in your cloud space as well as my photos. But now that I have run out of space
                                for videos I keep getting an error message on my app that is very annoying. I would
                                really appreciate more storage space for videos! Without having to pay the exorbitant
                                amount that you asked for video storage!</span>

                                <span>See screenshot for an example of what I'm talking about...<br><br>First, I'll say
                                    I've found Google photos to be far superior. I have both and pay for the extra
                                    storage for both even though I am a Prime member.<br><br>The biggest issue is Amazon
                                    photos duplicates photos relentlessly! I can go back through and find 3, 4, 5 and
                                    even 6 of the same photo, all together (sorted by date). So, I'll put the duplicates
                                    in the trash and they'll later reappear. If I eliminated 5 of the 6, maybe only 3
                                    will reappear, but holy crap, this is annoying.<br><br>The facial recognition is
                                    also better in Google.<br><br>I'm sure at some point in time, some attorney will
                                    initiate a class action suit because if you're paying for xxx amount of storaage and
                                    Amazon duplicates pictures, you may be paying for something you don't
                                    need.<br><br>My 2 cents. I hope you find this helpful.</span>

                                <span>Using the cloud for picture storage is a wonderful idea. This app and the free 5Gb
                                    storage is a great gift from Amazon. It makes it pretty much effortless to copy
                                    pictures to the cloud drive and then retrieve and view them anywhere you have access
                                    to the internet. All you have to do is install the software on the PC that lets you
                                    drag photo files to an upload area to upload them and download the app for your
                                    phone and/or tablet to view or retrieve the photos. You can also upload pics taken
                                    on your phone. Automatically, if so desired. It's easy as pie!<br><br>Would like to

                                <span>Man these have been the most awsome shoe I've owned. I'm a amputee,half of my left

                                    long Island foot brace in.Good snug fit and very comfortable. Now I'm ready for
                                    another pair, and of course Amazon doesn't sell them anymore.They're very difficult
                                    to find. If I try and order directly from overseas,once they find out I live in the
                                    U.S it's all over..they won't ship them .</span>

                                <span>I like to take photos, of family, friends, animals and nature, places I go and
                                    interesting things that I see. Mostly since my kids were born I take lots of photos
                                    of them. They're so cute and getting bigger every day. But sometimes (rarely
                                    thankfully) they have unknowingly deleted photos from my phone; Thank Goodness for
                                    the cloud drive automatically backing the photos up, I was able to retrieve my lost
                                    photos. The Amazon photo app also helps me a little with organizing my photos. But
                                    mostly I'm super happy that it helped me to find and retrieve my lost photos that I
                                    had thought were gone forever.</span>

                                <span>The app commonly starts using a large portion of my phone's CPU when it's trying
                                    to back up something, but when you open the app, it won't say what it's trying to
                                    back up. No way to cancel it, no way to tell what it's backing up, so far no way to
                                    resolve.<br><br>Also when I initially got the app it started to do an automatic
                                    backup of my photos and videos. Cool. When it said it was finished, I didn't realize
                                    that it hadn't actually backed up everything. I deleted the photos and videos from
                                    my phone only to find out that when it said it was done backing everything up, it
                                    had skipped dozens of videos. Years of my life's memories just gone. I wish I hadn't
                                    have trusted the auto sync.<br><br>I'm still waiting for some kind of answer as to
                                    why the app continually gets stuck on a single file and/or how to identity which
                                    file it's stuck on.<br><br>Cheap photo storage option which is great but the app has

                                <span>I love prime photos. However what I don't love about it is the facial recognition
                                    feature. It groups so many different people under one person and won't let you move
                                    individual photos. It would be great if we could move individual photos so I can
                                    name them or put them under an already named person. I've even tried deleting photos
                                    to rename a group of them. Once I remove those photos I deleted from the trash and
                                    add them back into my photos they are grouped again under the same person I deleted
                                    them from.</span>

                                <span>There is potential for a great service. I was/am interested in sharing photos with
                                    family. To in vote family you need to provide their email or phony number to Amazon
                                    who will send the invite with and an app. My mother could not figure it out on her
                                    or computer.. All my family, that I'd want to share with, has an Amazon account and
                                    there is no way to connect with them through Amazon it's self. I thing as a backup
                                    for your pictures it is ok and how I'll be using this service.</span>

                                <span>I do really like this app. Only thing is, I don't want to purchase the extra
                                    additional video storage. So when you set up to app for auto backup, it will keep
                                    alerting you that an upload is going on, when there really isn't. I wish there was
                                    an option to decline auto backup for videos. If that were available, 5 stars all day

                                <span>I don't have to worry about my phone running out of space anymore. I love that it
                                    automatically stores the pictures and videos in the cloud and I don't have to worry
                                    about uploading the pictures myself. I also love that I could make an album of my
                                    daughter for her first year and played it as a slideshow on the TV at her birthday
                                    party. Everyone loved it. And it also uploads the videos with limit of 20 minutes!

                                <span>This photo storage solution works for me. I'm ultra paranoid about losing my
                                    photos and videos, and unlimited storage is great. It's probably overpriced, but I'm
                                    just happy to have peace of mind and know my photos are safe. It's easy to use once
                                    you figure out where to find the app on the phone. I was at first using the Drive
                                    app and that didn't allow me to access my photos. This works.</span>

                                <span>Great app for the regular person who only takes a few hundred photos on their
                                    phone cause you get a good amount of free storage and if you need more it's not
                                    super pricey my only complaint is that you are only able to upload your photos
                                    through wi-fi with no option to use just your data so unlimited data becoming a norm
                                    for phone plans holds no weight in amazon's eyes cause it's Wi-Fi only so also not
                                    super helpful when on the go unless you know of a secure and fast Wi-Fi conection
                                    other than that it's still a great app</span>

                                <span>Why haven't I used this sooner?! I've had Prime for years and only recently
                                    learned of the other benefits...such as Prime Photos! My phone had about 5 gigs
                                    worth of pictures that took up all my space...but I put them in the mysterious
                                    Amazon cloud and now I have space again! I set it up so my pictures are saved
                                    straight to the cloud and I can just delete them off my phone. Awesome and I highly
                                    recommend if you're low on memory space.</span>

                                <span>Really love this app. It saved me from losing hundreds of pictures when my phone

                                <span>I love that Prime allows me unlimited storage and I can have all my photos in one
                                    place! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because if I keep getting unable to
                                    connect to prime photos when I am not on WiFi and then it pretty much sticks around
                                    the whole day. Kind of annoying, but otherwise a great service.</span>

                                <span>Works really good. The only thing is that I usually take a few pictures then save
                                    the best ones, but when a delete the others from the phone it keeps them backed up
                                    so I have to go to the app and delete them there as well. Wish I could set a
                                    schedule to back up so it would only back up at night.</span>

                                    denying access to images. Unlike this other site, Prime even let's me store video

                                <span>Its okay. I guess I was expecting that if I could store my photos from my phone on
                                    here that I could then delete the photos from my phone but I don't think that is the
                                    case. I tried with just one picture and when I deleted it from my phone it also
                                    deleted it from this app. Am I missing something? What is the point of having your
                                    photos (which are already slowing down your phone) saved in two different places? My
                                    phone is running so extremely slow! I think I am going to uninstall</span>
