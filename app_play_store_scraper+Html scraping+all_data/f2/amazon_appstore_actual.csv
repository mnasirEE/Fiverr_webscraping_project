Donottrade,1,Beware of trade in offer,10/9/2022,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."
Lyala meme,3,I thought this was amazing until‚?¶,13/09/2017,I thought this was amazing until‚?¶ the day I bought a MacBook Pro and it said it would take like 3 days so I waited 3 days and it was not there I called customer service and they said they were going to get me a new one and then I got a call from them and they said they can‚??t they have to find my old package and they never did so I bought another one and it happened all over again so I just went to the store and they said they were going to get me a refund and they did and I got 2 and I gave it to a customer who said the same thing happened but only once and that was the end of that and me and her did not get our money back but whatever at least it was over and that was all I care about
jadon said ut,3,The Upgrades,2/4/2015,"So, yea I don‚??t like appple because I have 2 daughters and only one of my daughter phone upgrades automatically but my other daughter‚??s phones doesn‚??t.I got confused so I called apple but when I call them no one answers so I try again but no one answers so now I just upgrade my daughters phone since it can upgrade on it‚??s on. Apple please fix this issue. Also, the Apple Store now using password which is annoying because my daughters love roblox but they come to me saying,‚?ù Dad can you put in the password‚?ù. This had got me confused because when did you have to start using a password to update a app but when I put the password in it keeps saying it‚??s wrong. Apple please fix these issues it‚??s kinda getting annoying."
KENDALL0998776126,3,I will be during apple,1/3/2022,Apple I done with updating my phone every 2 seconds also my phone keeps Turing on and back off it so annoying yall really need to stop scamming people for dumb items yes y‚??all have good quality but it‚??s annoying Idc if y‚??all say well you got scammed I‚??m not gonna get scammed. Y‚??all are gonna get scammed because you‚??re not even gonna get scammed cause I am sueing  ya‚??ll these Apple products are good or whatever but I‚??m so sick of having to update my phone every five seconds. I‚??m sick of it turning on and off by itself these phones are lagging. I update my phone and it says it supposed to be a better update but it‚??s not. It‚??s horrible. I literally update my phone not even a whole hour ago and it‚??s lagging. Y‚??all need to fix it fix it now.
dacappstoreus,3,Bad Apple service,12/6/2023,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."
BabyBree2712,N/A,Great way if you don‚??t want to come into the store,11/7/2023,I recently bought an iPhone 13 pro max and some AirPod pros I really do like the concept of just having a shop online because the Apple stores are constantly packed with people who like looking and admiring at the technology (which I don‚??t blame it‚??s nice) but I‚??m there knowing what I want and what to buy. The scheduled courier delivery was really good as well I scheduled the night before and it came around 2pm the next day and everything was nicely packaged and boxed up safely.

This one is hopeless, I have no ideawhy it‚??s even on here, and that‚??s too bad because I liked it andmaybe the folks willing to pay to have ads removed handle it that way.

Copahc,N/A,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,31/10/2021,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. It‚??s false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but l‚??m completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I don‚??t want to see. It‚??s ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I can‚??t give it a negative review because it won‚??t matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.
