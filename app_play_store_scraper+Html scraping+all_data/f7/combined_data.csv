                            several since I got my new phone almost a year ago. Has all sorts of built in functions and
                            is better at sorting than Google's pathetic gallery app. The ads are actually quite uncommon
                            and tame, however the ones with sound are annoying when they happen, but even that is a

                            And another small issue been when ever i add a new photo to a certain album an old photo
                            reappears as the newest photo and as the album thumbnail . If it's possible to return some

                            features suggested earlier, in my 14/03/22 review. Improvements still needed are: (1)
                            Fix/Increase speed of files upload, (2) Upload 'recent' files on Main Page by default, (3)
                            Increase minimum speed of '1' to move much faster on slideshow (4) Make Photo-Edit
