"May 13, 2024","Uninstalling. The app has become unusable. I can no longer share images from
                            the app. Everything is messed up in the app for sharing. I've been tolerating the updates
                            that made this app worse and worse, like the Devs are trying to make changes just to keep
                            their jobs or something. Now, it's not just inconvenient, it's unusable. You broke the app.
                            Going to find a new one. Also, why isn't the Camera Roll automatically part of the phone
                            anymore?!",1,,,Soli Deo Gloria,
"May 7, 2024","""So much better than any other gallery I've tried."" They've changed the way
                            the pics are shown when you use the app to post memes in forums, and now it's by most recent
                            and you can't get to folder view. I've contacted them twice and haven't heard back yet. As a
                            photo picker it's pretty much useless now, although it still allows me to set up folders
                            that the Horrible Google Photos can see 😭",3,,,Fritters Fritters,
"December 2, 2023","It offers me everything I want in a gallery app the interface is fantastic
                            and my favorite feature is the information feature which even though I have some very old
                            pics on most of them it's able to tell me what date they were taken on and that's very
                            important to me! The editing the ability to create a new album easily within the interface
                            it's just a fantastic gallery app highly recommended",5,,,Thomas Dawson,
"August 21, 2023","It was really good when I first installed it, but I discovered that it
                            irreversibly damages all my files. It places them in incorrect orders and somehow changes
                            the DATE they were taken. I finally removed the media permissions and tried with a system
                            app, only to discover they are still out of order. I have no way to fix this. The video
                            player also sucks, not letting me swipe to the next video is annoying, especially when the
                            current one is over. Edit: the files are reordered automatically.",1,,,Moonbeam Graves,
"June 1, 2023","Ads are EXTREMELY intrusive, blocking functionally just when you need it the
                            most. Today they disabled the ""skip video"" button - it's still there, just doesn't work.
                            Doesn't integrate well with other system apps. Crashes and locks up the phone regularly,
                            forcing reboot. This app sucks. I'll be deleting it as soon as I have time. Worst app I've
                            used in a long time",1,,,Bill Riley,
"January 7, 2022","I feel like my photos are safe because the app does not need wifi to work,
                            and my photos stay on the device. I just needed something to view my photos and videos. It
                            can also crop, which is what i've done, and saving the cropped photo makes a new image (i
                            believe). You can also change settings where if you delete a photo in the app, you can
                            direct it to permanently delete instead of going into the recycle bin. What i like too is
                            before you delete, it asks ""delete or recycle bin?"" . I like it.",5,,,Wikke Wicce,
"February 8, 2023","it's a Google photos ripoff, and Google photos is a TERRIBLE gallery. so,
                            you know.... ugly interface that won't allow you to organize anything, only without any of
                            the convenience that makes people settle for Google. and the fullscreen ads are just
                            obnoxious. I'm not going to pay you to stop, but I'll give you a rating. since you wouldn't
                            stop badgering. I guess it's just too much to ask for an app that's at least not UNpleasant
                            to use, that'll get out of the way & let you use it.",1,,,Megan Storm,
"March 21, 2022","This app is great. It allows you to keep pictures password protected and to
                            delete files directly, without having to send them to the recycle bin. A warning: if you
                            switch phones, be sure to save your hidden files on your sim card or the cloud--anywhere not
                            directly on your phone. One flaw with this app is that it won't transfer hidden files. So,
                            you will have to transfer your hidden files yourself and then re-save them onto the app. I
                            made this mistake, and I lost alot of important pictures.",5,,,Martin Neas,
"January 29, 2022","Great functional app for photos. I like that it has my photos in order and I
                            can view them in folders or expanded view. I also like that my videos are in a separate
                            place. It has a clean up tool that helps me keep duplicates out of the way. You get a
                            private folder as well for photos you want to keep hidden that has security protection.
                            *Updated* having to delete app because I can't delete any photos without permissions and
                            when the screen pops up it goes away and I've not been able to delete.",3,,,Emiley Smith,
"May 26, 2022","The app is great except a couple of things: 1. When moving files from one
                            folder to another it should keep the same order of last modified from previous folder it was
                            in, right now it switches the order when moving them and that can be frustrating. 2. There
                            should be an option to make videos play on a loop. 3. When it's in select mode, it should
                            make the selection when touching the whole thumbnail of the picture not just the little
                            circlein top corner. Frustrating when selecting multiple files.",4,,,felix muniz,
"November 11, 2023","Edit: Needs to updated. When viewing pictures, I rotate my phone to view my

                            until that is fixed. Review: Best gallery app! Has all the features, including secure
                            private section where multiple folders can be created. Has a great UI and also has uninstall
                            protection so less chance of losing pictures and videos. Love this! Please support this as

"May 14, 2023","A fantastic replacement to the horrible Google Photos app. Samsung users
                            will feel at home with this app as well. The only issue I have with it, is that it requires
                            'Unrestricted Battery Usage' to be enabled. The other options are literally greyed out. I
                            find that this app can use significant battery if left unattended. But other than that, it
                            feels good to actually be able to take control of my gallery again.",5,,,Andy Z,
"April 11, 2022","I wish I could get rid of the clean, private and recent tabs at the top but

                            by videos and pictures. I don't like how percise I have to be when selecting pictures to
                            move or be deleted etc, I have to click the upper leftmost corner of the picture or it won't
                            be selected. Other than that it suits my needs and so far can't complain much further.

"January 10, 2023","Yes. This app gets it. Best photo gallery app I've tried. And I've tried
                            several since I got my new phone almost a year ago. Has all sorts of built in functions and
                            is better at sorting than Google's pathetic gallery app. The ads are actually quite uncommon
                            and tame, however the ones with sound are annoying when they happen, but even that is a
                            pretty minor gripe all things considered. Keep up the good work",5,,,Alex Felix,
"September 2, 2023","I have no problems with this app I absolutely love it. But I do wish they'd

                            phone that would be very nice. Overall I definitely do recommend this app and I definitely
                            do recommend paying for subscription to get rid of ads it's worth it and it helps

"January 4, 2023","Would be great but for the intrusive ads. I guess I missed where it said

                            either. I'm no stranger to in app advertising and am happy to purchase an ad free version -
                            I just didn't see that option. This one was ridiculous. Most people looking for a photo just
                            want to quickly find it without having their phone hijacked by a video you can't get around.

                            feature closes the entire edit. That's Annoying. It will be nice to have a trial premium

"March 7, 2024","This my favourite gallery app for my photos. However sadly the latest
                            update. Really ruined the experience. Issue been while searching for my albums it just says

                            And another small issue been when ever i add a new photo to a certain album an old photo
                            reappears as the newest photo and as the album thumbnail . If it's possible to return some
