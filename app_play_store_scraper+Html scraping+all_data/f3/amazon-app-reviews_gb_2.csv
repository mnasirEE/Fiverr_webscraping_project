If they don‚Äôt might have to loo at apple or google but until it ends I‚Äôll wait.

The basic service is free with your Amazon Prime account but only offers a small amount of storage, which is OK for a few holiday snaps per year but if you take loads of Photos then you will want to upgrade your storage limit. The one big drawback with this service is that it only stores images in chronological order. Fine for many but if you are serious about your photography then it's a bit of a drawback. If you take thousands of Photos a year then you will tend to catalog your images into folders with meaningful names such as ""Bob a Sue's wedding"" and ""day out in Bogner"" for example which makes finding photos much easier than trying to remember the month and year of a photo you took 15 years ago.

No disrespect, Amazon, but you literally add nothing that isn‚Äôt already there with Apple. Both companies are fairly contemptuous of customers yet neither is smart enough to recognise there‚Äôs a demand from people willing to pay a premium to get away from the insipid basic free model.

Lastly it‚Äôs annoying that it will only upload from your phone when you have the app open - it won‚Äôt do it in the background and the night sync isn‚Äôt great as it is still leaving your screen on all night (even if it shades it black).

There are many other similar apps for handling photos, some such as picasa have been around for years, yet they have far more functionality than amazons efforts. I really hope amazon choose to build on the capabilities of this app.
Some specific gripes are lack of folder functionality, once loaded only the date taken is really a sortable criterial. No preservation of folder structures. For a few dozen photos that‚Äôs not an issue, but if you have tens of thousands uploaded from various sources, often with date errors, it is a nightmare.

My favourite things include:

- backed up RAW photos from my Sony A6xxx all show as previews, so there‚Äôs no need to keep old photos or .jpeg copies on my pc just so I can see a thumbnail 

- unlimited use for most of the image formats I use, with an Amazon Prime membership

- creates a searchable database of people, places & objects (seems to vary depending on image format)

- I find it very easy to use

Some things I would like to further improve:

- RAW photo previews do not show in camera adjustments, so the preview & downloaded copy don‚Äôt necessarily colour match (this may be dependant on camera)

- Does not seem to search RAW images for people objects

- Would love support for .insp files (360 camera images), including showing a preview of the file, and having as part of the unlimited use 

- Would love my Affinity Photo image edits to be included in the unlimited use

- There is a built in image editor but doesn‚Äôt support edits to RAW files (eg it would be nice to do basic corrections and save as a .jpeg or .png etc)

Store photos and you have access to many TVs programmes and movies, Netflix is ¬£83 a year this is only ¬£80 per year and also Netflix charge you for viewing there content on more devices. Where as Amazon lets you access your account from many devices at no extra charge. Glad I tried this out for free 30 days will be keeping much longer. Thanks Amazon",5,False,Mark Ellis,Excellent,
6844,2015-01-22 18:36:36,"Can't seem to load more than 8 or 9 pictures at a time without App crashing.
Advice from Amazon was delete, reinstall and don't upload more than 5 photos at a time.
For a service that offers unlimited photo storage that seems pretty poor, not going to spend hours backing up all my photos just 5 at a time!",1,False,R.S-J,Poor Functionality,
6845,2015-01-15 13:00:48,"Why does Amazon advertise unlimited photo access for Prime members, then not allow it. I'm a Prime member, but when I get to 5gigs I get a message telling me I need to buy more storage but if I was a Prime member I would have unlimited storage...

Then when I phone Amazon they tell me they don't understand it, promise to phone me back and never do!

Humph!",1,False,lubidog,No unlimited even if you ARE a Prime member,
6846,2014-11-17 22:23:44,"This is how Apple should've launched iCloud Photo Library  as far as I'm concerned yet its still in beta and to be honest at the moment it's completely unusable so I decided to use Cloud Drive for photos and the service, quality, integration and security of photos in this app is incredible.

Also I'd like to point out I don't work for Amazon.

Amazon Cloud Drive for photos is an amazing app it particularly helps if you have crying because you can stores many photos as you want within the Cloud Drive and it doesn't cost you anything additional videos and documents on more but you can get ¬£100 gig for ¬£32 a year 

You can rest assured all your photos are safe been hosted on Amazon is really stable cloud service.

Not sure why people are giving this one or two stars don't trust the ""inaccurate"" reviews try it yourself.

The only features this app is missing is metadata information from your photos is all you can really view is the file name",5,False,Artic6,Totally amazing for photo professionals,
