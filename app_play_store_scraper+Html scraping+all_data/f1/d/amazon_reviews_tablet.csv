            items to adjust the display to a single-column list nor the option (important to our 'system') to change the
            'album cover' images. There features weren't broken, so it's hard to to figure why they have been 'fixed' .
            What IS broken? Something in the automatic uploads system keeps turning ON random folders, mostly on the one
            device used for images 'in progress' & thus has but one not turned OFF.",2,"April 20, 2024"
Rachel Heidenberg,"I do like this app. I like that Amazon gives prime users unlimited full res storage but
            photos. But I CANNOT STAND the warnings that they will pause my uploads if I don't open the app. PLEASE GET
            RID OF THIS. Just back up my photos no matter what or have a longer window of time because I swear I get
            this notification every single day. Once a month I could see but I shouldn't need to open a photo app every
            single day.",3,"March 26, 2024"
Mark Weiss,"use it every day, really enjoy the picture taken onnthat date each year. They finally added
            a way the user can correctly tag people in photos. The facial recognition seems to have improved too. I
            should add that this is only possible on the app while using it on my PC. The apps I use on my iPhone and
            android tablet don't all for much if any editing of info on individual pics. You can edit the pictures,
            change coloring, crop but doesn't allow tagging people or editing when the Pic was taken.",5,"February 18, 2024"
Ann Lynch-Oasen,"This app gives me a secure way to back-up, permanently store, categorize and share my
            photos. One problem is that there does not seem to be a way to create ""sub"" albums, which I'd really like.
            Also, some people I've sent links to for an album tell me they can't open the links. Otherwise, I appreciate
            the lifelong free photo storage (for Amazon Prime members).",4,"February 9, 2024"
A Google user,"Amazon photos works great in a passive way, although sometimes it gets tripped up when
            installing on a new phone. Lately, it's been terrible at editing photos on the app. I try to edit, crop,
            apply filters, etc, but the photos don't get uploaded even though I save them. I see that it gets uploaded
            but it doesn't get displayed. What's going on with this?",3,"September 28, 2019"
A Google user,"Amazon fulfills my needs as a reader & a photo editing nut. I enjoy the books provided,
            the editing app for pictures as well as prime video. However, after loading the apps it can be difficult to
            open them requiring more than one try. While streaming videos can be frustrating when they keep freezing up
            or won't rewind/forwarding. Books are sometimes hard to download & open up to read. Nevertheless photo
            editing is a smooth running app I use daily & storing the pics w/sharing are the cat's meow.",4,"April 19, 2020"
Kathy,"Not a good update. Used to actually like this app, but not so with this latest update. Why
            did you get rid of so many abilities?! Select All? The ability to just drag your finger to select multiple
            pictures? The ability to just select a date and automatically select every picture for that date? The
            ability to set how you viewed the order of pictures without literally having to RESELECT it every time you
            open the app? I don't really want to use this app anymore, I'd rather just use the website.",1,"January 5, 2023"
Captain Packrat,"Constantly refreshes the screen, throwing me back to the top of the page. It can only sort
            by date, no option to sort by album or file name. Many of my photos have no thumbnail, just a broken image
            symbol, even though most of these will load if I tap on them. It mixes in photos on your device with photos
            in the cloud, with no way to sort or exclude one. For some reason the app only shows a portion of the images
            that I've uploaded, the others can be seen in the web version, but not this app.",1,"July 1, 2022"
Deborah Lopez,"Very frustrated. I didn't realize it would be so difficult to stop syncing my photos. There
            are photos I don't want uploaded and have done everything to stop syncing. Just don't work. Also, when you
            delete your photos from the App, it also remove it from your device. And before you comment on click on the
            three dots, and select remove only from the app and not the device, is not available. 😠",2,"February 1, 2022"
Lagniappe,"Works good but does some weird things. Like shows doubles. This is because of the amazing
            annoying feature that you can't turn off. I don't want to see my phone photos when I look at my cloud
            photos. I would like to be able to separate these rather than see doubles of everything. Incredibly annoying
            and rather short-sighted to not have this as an option. Show me ONLY my cloud photos please.",3,"July 13, 2022"
Joseph D. Fattaruso Jr.,"It's a photo app. There's not a lot of exotic extras that make it stand out to me and it
            seems quite the same as Google photos. Amazon offers free storage and other photo features. I like the
            editior and it's easy to work. The. Video player and editor are also good and easy to operate. My guess is
            if you're a Fire user that this is your photo app. If you're a Google person , photos is yours. I use both.
            I can't have enough options when it comes to photos and videos.",4,"June 10, 2021"
A Google user,"Great way to back up all your photos from your phone and devices automatically to the cloud!
            If you lose your phone or buy a new phone, all your pictures on your phone are already backed up on Amazon
            Photos so no worries! I also like the daily notification from Amazon Photos of photos I took from years past
            since I started on the app. Great memories! Awesome app!",5,"December 4, 2019"
Har Dryv,"I'm glad to have photo backups, but the app lacks many wise features. Importing doesn't
            retain existing folder designations. It will let you group uploaded photos, and you can view by group at the
            bottom. It collects stills and videos. App startup page should be customizable... a selected photo, a
            selected folder, a slideshow of a selected folder, etc. Improved the app and I'll improve my rating.",4,"November 4, 2022"
Thomas H,"It's a bit disappointing that as organized as my gallery is on my phone, everything just
            gets thrown in together when backing up to Amazon Photos. And it would be massively inconvenient to
            essentially have to organize all my photos twice.... This seems like quite the oversight. It should
            basically just copy my gallery over, folders and all, so that my existing organization stays intact. What a
            letdown. Other than that, it seems to work more or less as intended.",3,"December 29, 2021"
Levi Richardson,"100% CANNOT use this to back up photos on my Galaxy Fold 3. I have T-Mobile Home Internet
            (yes, that's a thing), but because the public IP is from a cellular carrier, this app thinks I'm on a
            cellular connection and won't upload photos ... ""Waiting for WiFi"" even though I'm connected to the WiFi
            network the router broadcasts. The setting about using cellular data for ""auto-upload"" doesn't do anything
            different. Still doesn't work. I can browse my photos already stored, just upload never starts.",1,"July 8, 2022"
A Google user,"Not still to par! I was disappointed to discover that I could not sort by the dates the
            photos were originally taken on my desktop app. I could not even sort by the name of my albums that begin
            with the year date for the album. I chat with Amazon technician to be sure I am not overlooking something.
            The technician corroborated my issue and promised that will be fixed in the future! There are many
            competitor services that have this simple feature.",2,"July 7, 2019"
A Google user,"As a Prime member I think only 5 GB of video storage is unacceptable. I haven't taken the
            full plunge into this app yet as far as all of its features. I do worry about being able to find the photo
            that I want to view since a lot of comments were made about having to search thru many photos to find the
            one, only to have it open up a totally different pic. Another reason I can't comment on the features is that
            I can't get my pics to upload to the site...it's on permanent pause and I can't get it to restart. It's been
            like this for about 2 months! Come on Amazon you are better than this. Make your Photo app the best one out
            there.",3,"December 4, 2018"
Kahlil Nurse,"The only good thing about this app is the free photo storage. It's very time consuming to
            organize and share your photos. You have to manually select each photo, instead of being able to drag your
            finger to select multiple. You also can't select all photos uploaded on one day. It's a very simplistic app
            that could work well for someone with only a few photos to manage, but the developers need to take a look at
            Google Photos and Samsung Gallery. Those apps are leagues ahead of this one.",1,"August 10, 2023"
Brian Stephens,"Some new features added, I guess, but now the albums are completely scrambled and albums are
            sorted by date created only. You can't sort by name at all when you want to assign a pic to an album. It
            would REALLY be helpful to have an album search function especially when you have a lot of albums and Amazon
            apps has just screwed everything up again with yet another bad update just as you fixed everything and tried
            to learn new methods from the last update.",2,"November 27, 2022"
Micah Flahaven,"Big fan of this app. It's great that you get unlimited photo storage for having a prime
            account, I can't think of any other storage service that offers unlimited storage. It's also packed with
            useful features comparable to photo storage programs like iCloud photos and Google photos (basically the
            best photo storage platforms available). However, I would love to see more features and an ugraded UI to
            make it easier to navigate faces and upgraded photo sharing capability to create shared albums.",4,"January 4, 2023"
Cindy Kieu,"This app used to be great and now it's terrible. I get trying to go for a minimalistic look,
            but now it's just unusable. It took me several weeks to figure out how to manually upload my videos (don't
            have it on auto on purpose). There's no longer an icon that tells you what's not uploaded, so it's a giant
            guessing game. You used to be breaks in between date photos were uploaded or taken, and now it's just a
            giant glob of photos. I haven't found anything to like about it since the update.",1,"November 25, 2022"
A Google user,"The auto upload feature is nice when it works. Have option to use data or wifi. On wifi if
            you pause the the upload it starts all over again when you resume, Guess I don't know what pause mesns. No
            matter if I choose data it pauses automatically and tells me there is no wifi and hitting resume does
            nothing. There is zero info on what overrides what when you delete a photo. The information on most
            functions is weak or does not exist.",3,"November 30, 2019"
Bill Del'Marmol,"Since the Oct 28th update this app is totally useless. Spent an hour on the phone with
            customer service who was unable to solve new problem. Can't manually add pics. App says pic securely saved,
            but you can't see them in the Amazon Photos app. One solution was to go to the actual Amazon Photos website
            and upload there. That defeats the purpose of this app. They need to update this app asap. The previous
            version worked great",1,"November 1, 2022"
Jane Piepes,"Much is available here for unusual creations ... without including unnecessary Templates, .
            .for kids, etc. They also, seem to arrange all your photos in a nice display for You ... exluding all your
            own mistaken screen shots,,,as well..and duplicates. They allow you flexibility in this program. Much

Ironic Logic,"This is SO MUCH BETTER than Google Photos!! Seriously, there's no comparison. I freaking
            hate Google Photos & wanted something different. I tried a few but this one is amazing! It has more
            options, a much better design, it's easier to navigate and find what you're looking for & the BEST
            EDITING TOOL! It puts Google to shame! (40 different filters, stickers, overlay, text, adjustments, etc...)
            And best of all, Amazon Prime members get free unlimited storage for all their photos.",5,"November 13, 2020"
Kerry Bruce (Snowdohn),"I love Amazon Photos because 1)It keeps any & all photos I download or take. I don't
            even have to think about it since it uploads & backs up all my photos. 2)The editing tools are really
            good & I enjoy using them. 3)I don't have a limit that I'm aware of which is nice. I love ALL of the
            apps & products that Amazon offers. 4)The app is user friendly & considering I'm not very computer
            savvy this is very important. Thank you Amazon!😁😘",5,"September 10, 2020"
D,"I do not like this new photo app, the old one was so much better. Whenever I try to view the
            daily memories, I scroll through the pictures & it keeps scrolling back to the top by itself. Very
            annoying. I also don't like the fact that you have to buy extra video storage once the 5gb is used up. I
            can't even delete the videos that are using up space. It would be nice to have unlimited video storage as
            well. 1 star for this new app.",1,"January 10, 2023"
A Google user,"Took photos with Alexa. Amazon saved them to their server. Installed this app on my tablet.
            using this app, I accessed the saved photos and downloaded them to my tab, then deleted the ones on their
            server. ok. Fine. Not liking the app for various reasons, I uninstalled it. However, in doing so, the app
            deleted all the downloaded photos saved on my tab. UNACCEPTABLE!",1,"January 17, 2019"
liang tan,"not as good as google photos app. this app will show all photos in the photos tab, including
            screenshots, all photos from social media etc. could have been better if other folders aren't being
            displayed in the photos tab so it won't mix cameras and backed up photos. The not-backed-up icon on the
            lower left of images aren't very useful either, it will just blend in with any image that has the
            same/similar color in that particular area, masking the icon so it's hard to tell if it's backed up/not

Jo Ann Swampgirl24,"Confusing!! New update should be trashed. Everything is all mixed up. I cut the auto-upload
            off so i don't have to look everywhere in Amazon photos to find them. Can't find by date. And downloading
            pictures for my Mom's memorial CD for her wake/visitation was a nightmare and got a migraine while trying to
            figure it out. Keep it simple so it don't take so long to do what we need to do in the app. PLEASE CHANGE IT

Ronald Brooks,"The updated app sucks compred to the previos version. It's stuck in portrait orientation, It
            does not sense if my tablet is in landscape mode and adjusts, which it normally is because I have a keyboard
            cover. Hate the way Pictures On This Day from previous years works now. Inferior update. I'd tke the old app

ShonnaLee,"I once absolutely loved the design of this app. Since the most recent update, it's so
            difficult! I can't edit the faces, or anything else. Difficult to find who wasn't added to the right face

Lara Carter,"Does a great job organizing photos but it's REALLY frustrating that it doesn't allow you to

Horribal Gamer,"Disappointed with the new update. No landscape, no time or date stamps on new pics. Doesn't

Scott H,"Use this app in conjunction with our echo show to display family pics (digital picture

Zeeba Neighba,"Amazon photos far surpasses the quality of Google photos. They are cheaper to order, editing
            is intuitive, and the quality is superb. Since Amazon photos include the auto uploading from Google photos,
            there's no lag time waiting for your photos to show up~ Google is very often delayed in uploading.",5,"March 6, 2023"
Robert Hinkle,"I only use this app because it took place of the Amazon Drive and all my photos/videos were

James Bean,"Take a picture on any of your devices and it appears on all your devices....of course if you
