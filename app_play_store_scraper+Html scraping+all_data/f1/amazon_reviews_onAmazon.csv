Amazon Photos Reviews
"Instant, confident, wonderful"
My photos downloaded as .jpg cannot be edited in Photoshop
good storage amount for the price
App user friendl
Usully very nice. and very safe for what I store here.
very good experience
"I always enjoy this. it's a must have for me and my family.
                                    "
great app
"Find this to be very useful way to share photos across different
                                        platforms. Working out how to use it is different for Chrome, Android and
                                        Windows and I've found that part tricky. Would recommend it."
Very fast uploads.
"Only disappointment is the family vault that's supposedly locked
                                        is not as more recent photos are added."
"This app allows me to save my pictures to a platform that my,
                                        almost 70 year old dad, can access without a bunch of confusion or frustration
                                        due to technology. We live in the same home, so we share our Amazon account.
                                        It's very convienent."
"I love this app especially whenit sends me reminders of the past
                                    "
as google as the other popular one

                                        doubt."
This is such a good experience. üòÅ
"I enjoy this app though I wish the computer version had the
                                        slideshow feature like it does on my kindle."
Great service with unlimited storage
Great
"I don't have any control over this. Not user friendly and the
                                        layout stinks"
Prime benefit comes in very handy. Love it!

"Trying to get photos from my motorola mobile. Nothing happening

Easy to use
"The Amazon photos app is deplorable! Not at all user friendly.
                                    "
"Free storage as a Prime member. Excellent for keeping and
                                        organization."
"thanks for the $20 credit on amazon and also the app seems to be
                                        helpful as well."
"I lo ve this app! It savesall of pictures. Puts together memory
                                        stories for me to view and save, I can order all or some of my pics,
                                        en.argements, memory books, canvases and much more!"
no photo editor.
I enjoy seeing these photos displayed on Alexa.
"I wish I had an option whether to add a photo to Amazon photos
                                        or not ? !"
Best in class photo storage solution.

"I like having another place for my photos. And this is included
                                        with my Amazon Prime membership which I love"
I truly enjoy using Amazon Photos.
"Love To Be Able to Use My Pictures For Screem Saver On My TV

"This app is new to me, so I'm still discovering its
                                        capabilities. So far, it all looks good!"
"This is a great start and service. It needs some work in
                                        regaurds to import, organization, and user interface ease. I really hope they
                                        continue to develop this app into its ultimate potential. Thank you!"

Great App
Very nice
"I've have found Photos that I thought I had lost a long time
                                        ago."
awesome
"This app works fine the only draw back is I also have a google
                                        app for photos I wish they could be combined into one place for all my photos
                                    "
"it works great. I have experiences times on amazon photos but
                                        those who rated it one star are going to hell"
"Love Amazon Photos especially when it gives daily memories from
                                        the past!"
will not download pictures
"I am a Prime subscriber, so I am able to store many pictures
                                        safely. It is easy to use and the quality remains great."
I have been using this app for years very user friendly
"My pics are now organized, making them more pleasant to look
                                        at!!"
So far so good. works with no problems.
"Simple to use, great features, available on every platform"
easy
So far so good but there are anomalies
"Loved this app back in September/October but now I can't find
                                        the ""folders"" I transferred from my device, now I have to look at each and every
                                        photo vs the system I had set up. The disorganization of trying to find a folder
                                        is mind boggling. The update really took away from the value of this app."
"I wish it was more opiotomized for Chromebook, but, other than
                                        that, I lve it!"
"Great on my phone but won`t open to full page on my Chromebook.
                                    "
"doesn't work, rubbish, uninstalling"
"Hard to figure out how to go through the steps. Got stuck after
                                        select photos. Uninstalled for now because it wasn't working for me."
More space than I will ever need.
Great I just wish it had bigger storage
"One great place to store all my photos and look at them whenever
                                        I want."
great!!
easy to use
loving the clarity of photos!
very good organising photo's
"Very unreliable --newer albums sometimes don't show up on some
                                        devices, sometimes they're just empty."
"I Love This App, I've Had It Since 2009 And Never Lost A Photo.
                                        Thanks"
"12/11/2021 - Why is it so hard to organize the pictures?!!! And
                                        the duplicates are annoying üôÑ I don't like that I cannot stop it from Auto
                                        uploading and if you delete from Amazon it deleted from device"
"I love using this app. It's a great way to organize your photo
                                        memories and it also provides great ""extras"". The ""Memories"" feature and ""This
                                        Day"" features provide a great way to remember special moments and days. I use it
                                        for all my photos, and am able to save them in the cloud in full resolution,
                                        even those taken with my DSLR."
"So good, got all my pic one place"
"Great way to store my photos and videos. Easily accessible and
                                        very organized. Lots of storage space."
good

great app
"Set it and forget it. Love it for all my photos. Especially like
                                        the screensaver for the TV option."
so far so good
"Easy to use, but it would be nice to have better
                                        filtering/searching options to find my photos."
not bad but not my primary choice
"i did not set up amazon it was on a previous phone they stole
                                        with sim card and i cant take it of facebook so they always hack it and follow
                                        me again send a dam angel this place is for scrreaming deamons"

"App does not work. Either will not let me log in, or closes
                                        after log in, or says it can't connect to Prime Photos and I've tried
                                        installing, uninstalling, and reinstalling on multiple devices."

"app keeps stopping on my chrome book. According to Amazon
                                        customer service, app will not work on chromebook. It will work from my Android
                                        phone, however now can not print to my printer. Only Amazon can print, that is a

"Just installed this on new Chromebook.Every time I launch it, it
                                        crashes almost immediately. At this point it is absolutely worthless."
The app wont open on my Chromebook. Not impressed.
"ALWAYS crashes! This app on a chromebook never works and it
                                        sucks. Don't waste your time"

"There doesn't seem to be a Chromebook version of this app. It
                                        installs fine on my Chromebook but then crashes when trying to get my photos.
                                        Its clearly meant for a phone as the window it opens is sized for a phone."
App keeps shutting down. Can't use it at all.
I enjoy this feature on my computer
Crashes at startup. Does not work on chromebook.
didn't work for me on my chromebook
"never gets passed, app has stopped message."

                                        you ever make this compatible with Chromebook, I might try again."
"I'm having trouble opening this app on my chrome 3 notebook.i've
                                        had this app for years on my Samsung galaxy phones with no problems. Can I get
                                        some help?"
"other than limited editing features, good app"
Wont respond.
"Directions are not very clear. It took awhile to fumble around
                                        to figure out how to open after downloading."
"Great application for storing important pictures, documents or
                                        other files and it's SECURE!"
garbage
"I have a new Chromebook and downloaded this app. I like the
                                        features such as organization of pictures into albums, and the auto-load.
                                        However, it crashes frequently and I have to reopen the app again and again, and
                                        it does not return to my previous location. Would like a feature where the
                                        metadata would be shown beside or below the picture so that I could better
                                        identify it. Also would like to be able to move faster through the pictures.
                                        This may be my computer's issue."
"Easy and intuitive, Easy to share photos with family members,
                                        etc. Notifies me when those photos are ready to view. Great quality viewing.
                                        Easy to download and upload. I dont organize the photos or anything with the app
                                        - I use my PC."
setting this up was painfull
"will not stay on screen, moves off screen everytime you click a
                                        photo"
"Editting feature broken on Chromebook. The app says there was a
                                        problem downloading the image. That aside, another great way to backup the
                                        family's photos, and free up space on our phones."
EASY TO DO FOR AN OLD TIMER
