We pay the $9.99 a month for Office family and we each get a terabyte in backup to our OneDrive and five accounts. This way I can bring my work with me anywhere and either keep working on it or show off my progress to friends or prospective volunteer opportunities. 

For the more normal person (not a nerd) after you take some photos make sure to open OneDrive to backup to the cloud, and then your home computer; then easily accessed from any device anywhere. 

There are a lot of data backup programs out there but most aren’t cheap, but for a terabyte for $7.99 or $9.99 (single account Office 365 and family account Office 365 respectively) which comes with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, plenty of other software for anyone. 

Even without a 365 account, it’s worth using even if to keep your photos safe at home and on the go. 

Also I’m not a bot or paid advertiser, I just feel like of the options, Microsoft isn’t as evil as most big tech companies, but they’ve been around since I started using pc computers in 1988, so they’re unlikely to go anywhere soon, so your data is safer than some others whom I discovered had corrupted my irreplaceable photos on the cloud when my computer died.

1,2019-09-18 17:12:27,"I can’t praise enough OneDrive. I had been using it since the SkyDrive days. Those days were storage heaven. I was able to rack up to 50 gigabytes of free storage. Well, OneDrive came to life and changed things. Some improved and some got canned like the amount of free storage. That is the only reason it I take one star from it. The good stuff it’s what in my opinion, makes OneDrive the number one app for online storage. Easy to sync files across Windows PC and IOS mobile devices. The integration of OneDrive with Windows Personal files can be somehow problematic since by default makes OneDrive upload everything you put on those folders. If you don’t want every file on those folders getting uploaded and take precious space just change the settings on Windows to stop OneDrive to upload the content on those folders. I found less complicated to just create a new folder on the system Desktop and name it “My OneDrive” then create sub-folders for E-books, Pictures, spreadsheets and so on... then drop there everything I want to sync across mobile devices. That way I have more control over what goes into One Drive instead of letting Windows do it for me.

First, it does have files app integration which for some reason only allows you to copy files from the iPad to OneDrive, not to simply move them. Second, they say it has multi window support for iPadOS 13 but not really. Each time you try to add another window, you get an error message saying that you can only open a file in another window, not another file browser. Also you are very limited in terms of sort and view options, you can only view files in a list or as icons. When viewing photos and videos with the icon view, you can’t see the file name and can only do so by clicking the info button for each individual file.

6,2021-06-18 11:30:48,"OneDrive is my go-to cloud storage system, allowing me to store all of my files online and share them easily among my various devices (PC, iPad and iPhone).  My Office 365 subscription gives me 1 TB of storage, more than enough for my needs.

The IOS OneDrive app does a good job displaying your files and folders and lets you easily navigate between them. It works especially well with the Office apps, auto-saving your files as you work with them.

Two major complaints about the app:

1) If I navigate to a nested folder within my OneDrive folder, switch to a different app and then return to the OneDrive app, it often “resets” to its root folder, forcing me to re-navigate to where I was.  This is even more frustrating if I’m viewing one of my files (e.g., a PDF file) within OneDrive.  Upon return to OneDrive from another app, the file is closed and I’m back at the root folder, forcing me to reopen the file I was viewing.  I have a feeling this is due to limited memory space, but just dumping me out of my current context seems a poor way of handing the memory restriction.

2) OneDrive is not well integrated with IOS or other apps.  For example, if I want to save an online PDF file I find while using one of the browser apps (Safari, Chrome, etc.), there’s an option to save it to DropBox but not to OneDrive.  I usually end up having to save the file to Dropbox, import it to the Adobe Reader app, save it to OneDrive from there, and delete the copy on Dropbox.",4,False,prlaba,Good but frustrating,

Also, if I create a new folder, I am unable to paste a copied set of text into it - I am only allowed to save a file or graphics into it.  Apple’s iCloud storage allows me to do all that.  Unless you upgrade to include those plus other features more, users like myself would be inclined to eventually move most of our storage to Apple’s iCloud - which is also cheaper than your monthly subscription.

My frustration is trying to make sense of using OneDrive. It is not very user friendly on instructions. I had to cut files from my primary folders on my computer and paste them in folders on my desktop (or anywhere else), because I could not get the system to only save the files I wanted. You’re supposed to be able to choose which files go to OneDrive, but I still can’t get the system to do that so things like pictures and PDFs, which take a lot of space, have been moved out of My Pictures and My Documents.

First, the iOS app constantly crashes. You open a directory to browse and it either crashes or fails to load. The bugs don’t stop there. Sort by date and for the most part it works, but there will be random files at the top (newest) that don’t belong, often more than a year old.

Second, the app doesn’t sync in the background.  You might think that you could use OneDrive instead of paying for iCloud to sync your photos. But with iCloud your photos always sync; no need to worry. With OneDrive you have to open the app to the photos tab before they sync. So all those great photos you took on vacation you thought were automatically syncing weren’t.

Finally, the Windows PC version suffers from the same unreliability. Random files don’t sync, especially Microsoft Visio files.  The app will pause itself without warning, something you’ll only find out days later when an important file is out of date. You’ll put the icon in your always-visible taskbar icons to make sure you’re warned of issues, and on the next upgrade it reverts to hiding in the extra icons pulldown.

A big ward why don’t you have this is a select all feature. Every other major app has it and people in forums have been asking for it for over 3 years now. Still nothing. So spent over an hour swerving each picture individually to try to download back to phone. As soon as I hit download. App crashes. Start over. Suddenly getting errors that I can’t download certain files with no explanation and app crashes again. So now my pictures are being held hostage. I can’t cut the cost because of this.

1.) when i am working on a document that i had uploaded to MSOD, & if i exit and then come back to it later to continue editing, the FONT will change from what i previously picked before-to-HELVITICA font. Then, i have to RE-EDIT the formatting for ALL the different sections that i had put any text in my document. Which is really odd & very annoying!

2.) when i am working on my document it will often just close out & any editing i had done will NOT saved, so if i was writing something and it just closed out, then everything that i had just done, would be LOST!

Can’t download files for offline use. Says “There was an issue affecting the download of…” or something along that line. 
Open in another app rarely if ever works. The popup would appear, you tap on the app, and it wouldn’t do anything at all or would hang for 5-10 minutes on large files
Common filetypes, like mkv, is still not supported after being requested by users YEARS ago. 
General instability and UI bugs/missing features are common. For instance, where is the select all or select multiple files/folders option? It looks like you have to awkwardly tap & hold the folder/file, but that rarely works. 
Sometimes files aren’t completely downloaded/uploaded, Trying to open/download those files would mean working with a corrupted file, but there is no indications of it on the app. There should be incomplete upload/download indication.

To illustrate my point i need to also state that i was fair to many competing systems and also equally utilized their software and apps to incorporate redundancy in backing up my data.  And over the years, the results that I have had for my own particular experience is that only Onedrive has kept all my files just as they were in the beginning, non have been somehow corrupted or lost in a cloud system, no policy changes have prevented me from accessing my stuff, it has been kept safe from being hacked, and has been reasonably price and fair on their updating and time given to recover or prevent account deletion. Google,  not so much, dropbox is better than google but pricey in my opinion. Apples icloud is a close second for me and is also quite good and reliable. The only problem i do have with their service, which broke the tie between iCloud and Onedrive, ultimately handing victory over to Microsoft’s Onedrive cloud storage as my preferred choice and personal recommendation. I feel that Apple only lost the tie due to a lack of user friendly accessibility regarding Apple’s Account security. While i am glad and appreciate Apple’s Account Security Measures, it is also a double edged sword. God forbid you ever suddenly lose access to your phone because the situation just might arise in which a broken phone also means that you may mot be able to get back into your account and thus lose everything, defeating the whole purpose, although, i must mention that many improvements have been made and so this may no longer be the case for other user. It just happened to be for me.  
So with all that said and kept in mind, my conclusion is that in my opinion, Onedrive is the best deal for the money and has kept everything that i uploaded without some strange problems later preventing retrieval. I hope in the future that Microsoft turns from the direction that google is taking and decides it is better to keep their customers and users happy rather than having a hidden agenda and abuse of power. I cant believe i actually just endorsed Microsoft, but setting aside some questionable business practices, they have offer me a reliable and affordable product/service.

1. The Folder path/hierarchy is shown in the top bar as to give an idea where one is currently and not just ‚Files’ as is now the case.
2. The same goes for files. Once a file is open the top line shows the path and the file name. If one has 20 files in one folder one knows emidiatly what file one was in before closing the file to go to the next file and possibly opening the same file again because one does not recollect the previous file name.
3. Please ad the function that one can work on a office document and then safe it to an existing shared folder. For example one team member creat‘s a doc and places it into a shared folder. I then edit this doc and can not directly safe it back into the shared folder. It would be great if all folders shared or not are treated like folders that people who have the permission can use the folder like it would be their own folder. 
4. The same as above goes for a new doc one person creates and then what’s to place it into a shared folder. Even so I have found a work around this could be solved much easier through the ‚Move‘ function. Workaround: you have to create on the web interface of one drive a shortcut link of any shared folder to your home folder.

3000,2017-09-21 13:40:48,"OneDrive has come a long way over the years, as have the other major players in the game.  If you're like me and know you will be using Microsoft 365 Office Applications for the foreseeable future then OneDrive can't be beat in terms of ease of use, cost and compatibility.  I am primarily an iOS user (iPad Pro) but my phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note and my work computer OS is Windows.  OneDrive works seamlessly between all these devices and operating systems.  I frequently open the same spreadsheets on all three devices throughout the day as I travel and it, for the most part, doesn't skip a beat.

Now, please don't think it is absolutely perfect and flawless because it is not.  The one area where I have run into problems is due to my heavy use between different devices without closing the files beforehand.  OneDrive has improved greatly over time but, as an example, if I have a file open (File A) on my PC and edit it without closing it and my PC reboots due to a power failure or whatever I will end up with at least one additional auto-saved file (file B).  What compounds the problem for me, due to my heavy use among various devices, is that I will most likely open the file on my iPad and edit it.  Keep in mind that if the PC has been shut down or rebooted, OneDrive will now make File A (I'm pretty sure of that but could be File B) available for editing.  So I edit the file on my iPad and close it, saving the changes in the process.  I will now have yet another version of File A to contend with and it may or may not have other changes from File B incorporated.  The process to sort this out would be to compare the files and merge them with the most recent data.  Unfortunately this isn't a simple process when there are three or more files to deal with, each with 15 or 20 spreadsheet tabs.  Overall, this situation may be universal among cloud drives but I don't know for sure so I included it for full disclosure.  I still highly recommend OneDrive and doubt my problems will affect the vast majority of users.",5,False,Edmonds007,I have all of the major cloud drives - OneDrive is at the top.,

4448,2023-02-09 09:04:55,"Solid app overall, this is my new go-to for file storage, as Dropbox is too expensive and has a subpar interface. OneDrive is responsive, and seems to integrate fairly well on mobile/desktop platforms. The users ability to customize the experience is limited, though, and user manuals on the Microsoft website are outdated. Syncing controls and other Preference settings are absolutely minimal.

This app is almost great, but one thing most “in-app purchase” or “subscription” based services do, is that they always try to force you to enable features you purposely disabled. For example: I do NOT want camera uploads enabled. So why do you constantly show a banner telling me to turn it on? I disabled it on purpose, as I’m sure some other users do the same. Stop trying to force me to enable this feature. I pay for this service now, there should be ZERO intrusion. It’s like it’s ad-free but Microsoft can still advertise their own features in the app, and there is no way to hide or disable them.

Second, why is there a For You/Recent/Offline section on the Home tab? I don’t need a moments or memories feed, I am aware what is in my file storage, and I don’t need reminders of what was created on what date, or what it looks like. The “Home” screen should have a completely different function, because it is actually a privacy issue when personal files/images are immediately viewable once you open the app instead of in a folder. Furthermore, a folder without a thumbnail would be a better idea. Again, I know what’s in the folder, so I don’t need a visual preview.

Lastly, any paid plan should allow the user the ability to upload to the Personal Vault with no limits. So I can store 100Gb, but for some reason the Personal Vault only gives me 3 free uploads? The cash grabbing needs to stop, people are willing to pay for storage, so why cut down on the features that actually make OneDrive usable?",4,False,Stiillwoozy,Needs Few Improvements,

When I log in to my account it tells me I’m under the 5gb plan which I have NEVER been under I have also always payed for the extra storage, (6.99 a month) so I made sure the money came out of my account and there was no issues. Once I was able to verify the money had been taken out I did an online chat which was NO HELP! (Save your time!) I explained how when I logged into the app it was only giving me access to the free features and that I had spent money on the premium version and wasn’t being compensated for the in app purchase of 6.99 subscription per month. The response I got was literally as if a child was helping me, he had no idea how to fix my problem and tbh I don’t think he even cared. I had sent screenshots to explain and show what was happening and do you know what they said?! Remember I contacted this app about THERE problem, and they told me to contact Apple for an issue with Apple subscriptions, reluctantly (hate having to explain the issue over and over) I did! I was on the phone with Apple for over an hour for them to tell me to contact the developer and wait. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT?! I contacted the app directly who told me to contact Apple to basically email the app developer it seems like a run around to me! I pay money for an app to WORK! Not be told to contact 3 separate people and waste hours.. SMH I will NEVER COME BACK TO THIS APP!

Loss of sync has happened when the file was closing but the application was unable to complete the upload. It has also happened spontaneously during a session. When it loses sync, it goes into an endless sync loop and begins to create a whole new root directory for all of your files (in my case up to 50GB of files) and  places files randomly into subdirectories, some in the new file tree and some in the old and some into both. There is no way to tell which is the most current version or which are duplicates other than to go folder by folder and compare file sizes and dates. Each time this has happened, I have had to hire an IT tech to stop the sync looping and then it has taken me days to reorganize my files into the correct folders and eliminate duplicates. Microsoft does not provide phone support for this app and email support takes days to get a response and all they do is email you the same information you can obtain from Microsoft community bulletin boards. This is a SHAMEFULLY DEFECTIVE product and should not be used in any important application. I have removed all critical data from the OneDrive server and keep a local backup of the few files I have left on the server. I am not a technical novice; I am a Chief Engineer (electrical) for a major defense electronics corporation. I have led major software product developments and I assure you a product like this would not be released until these glaring defects were fixed.

4718,2018-12-30 06:13:54,"Sept 2018: I decided to upgrade my O365Personal to O365Home, but unable to do so because my O365P was purchased through Apple! (MS Store emptied the shopping cart 2.9ms before my submit purchase and gave an error). I was told, via chat and voice call, I could 1) wait until my renewal anniversary for O365P with Apple and discontinue with Apple, or 2) create a new O365H account at anytime, under a different email, and begging syncing them up ASAP. #2 seemed like a reasonable approach, but I didn’t want to create a new email address so I went #1 and waited until the next month to drop my existing O365P and upgrade from there. 

Oct 2018: Renewal Anniversary date for O365P but same MS Store shopping cart error was occurring! So now I felt I had lost a month of sync time with option #2, but I plowed right in while logged in to new O365H from WEB.... OMG!!! I followed the help info online for this and began migrating files over from old O365P to the new O365H, first sharing a folder from old to new and placing all 4 of my base folders and then using COPY, but then, for reasons I do not know, the COPY option disappeared and only the MOVE was available. I new this would take a while with about 380GB to copy. I did not try to do it ALL at once, but it quickly looked like it would handle all I could give it. I logged in that night, from a different computer, onto the web to check its progress. Everything seemed fine.
  Nothing was fine!!! Next day I find there are duplicated folders created in the new 1Drive, and (i.e. Pictures, Pictures (1), Pictures (3)... with SOME of the files in each of them, but SOME files in the Parent folder, and no good way to determine if I got everything!

Nov-Dec 2018: Numerous emails with MS support back and forth and they still to this day HAVE NO FREAKING CLUE WHAT HAS CAUSED ANY OF THIS! And in spite of the fact I have been told over and over that they are investigating the issue, I feel that each tech that has looked my my issue for only 2.9 seconds and lobs another set of instructions at me on what to do, via email, contradicting what I was told would definitely work the day before!!! None of their instructions have helped the situation!

I hope I catch on quick because productivity is important to me. I don’t want to be the public employee that spends all his time on the computer and doesn’t get any actual work done. This is getting better to some extent, However it takes an in ordinate amount of time to get the process down. It is like no other program, filing system, Or other programs. I assume the goal is to store things in the cloud, paperless Lee and make it easy for managers to review my work. Since my work is scrutinized, When I do it I like to be able to put my hands on a copy of it. With the cloud there is no assurance that the connectivity will be good and the document will be saved versus lost. So I end up saving it in three or four places in hopes of finding it again but when updates are made to it it doesn’t seem that I can find the document that I was working on in the past this will take more time more effort and maybe there is some training available?

So until it becomes easy, I do it often enough, I take time off of fieldwork to go into the office to do training, or I want to spend more of my personal time looking at screens in typing on miscellaneous devices I am just going to put in my required time in theAllotment given and hope for the best.

4850,2021-09-10 17:44:55,"This is literally the worst and most frustrating app I have ever used. It lacks the most basic, obvious functionality that every single Microsoft computer already has, like the ability to copy and duplicate files, view the entire file path in search results (currently only the destination file is shown, which is virtually useless), or globally sort folders for thumbnail/list view or sort order. You have to individually sort every single folder for both of these factors, and redo all of that sorting if you ever delete and redownload the app (which you will need to, since it’s frequently buggy). 

The search function works inconsistently, and often misses files that I know perfectly well exist, and this leaves me to go hunting for things manually a lot of the time. I recently had to use my computer to locate a file that I should have been able to find on my iPad, but which wasn’t coming up in the app at all. My MacBook found it instantly using the Finder, though, and showed me the entire file path details. I often have to use my laptop or other apps to locate files like this, but still cannot do it on my iPad, because OneDrive refuses to open the search function to third-party apps that work better, like Files or Documents.

I have reported these problems to Microsoft countless times over the years, and am always glibly told to go and “vote” for what should be the most intrinsic of functions, and which literally EVERY SINGLE OTHER FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ALREADY HAS. I have in fact voted, many times, but nothing meaningful has ever changed or improved. I’m still left struggling with these major deficiencies, which would be incredibly simple to implement, and it vastly affects my workflow and frustration level. It’s abundantly clear that they use this “voting” system to simply avoid having to make significant changes to the app. In recent years the only upgrades I’ve seen have been an entirely useless home page, and a “secure” folder that I didn’t need, since one would hope that all my folders are secure!!

4852,2017-10-19 02:52:27,"I’ve recently made several purchases of MS’s programs I am installing these on the several Microsoft computers I own. I decided to move the new Win Pro 10,I installed, from one computer to a different computer. I attempted to uninstall WIN PRO 10 from my laptop and reinstall WIN 10 Home. Microsoft’s installation tool asked me for a product key to reinstall WIN’s. Microsoft claims that they cannot detect my previous WIN’s license. Microsoft advised me that if I want to reinstall WIN 10 Home that I have to repurchase it. Instead, I purchased another addition of MS PRO 10 for the computer that I wanted to transfer programming to. I contacted MS today, before I accepted the licensing agreement on my new OS install. I asked MS support to detect my current OS license so it doesn’t get lost like the other one did. I was told not to worry about my digital licensing that MS could automatically detect all my licenses and that I wouldn’t have any problems reinstalling WIN 10 HOME. MS is refusing to honor the rights I’ve purchased to their programming. MS lost one of my digital licenses and then told me that I had to purchase a new one, SO I DID. MS is refusing to give me the key to what I purchased, so I can protect and use it as I have the right to. MS is acting like they don’t want anyone to own MS program rights. The new trend in programming is to rent it to users. Everyone is going to end up paying exponentially for program usage rights. I’m starting to think that individuals should stop doing business with programming giants like MS. You can download “Open Office” or “Google Docs” FOR FREE and then pay techs every now and then to fix problems you can’t handle. You can also buy Apple devices that you can download free apps to that are created by Apple, like “PAGES” and “NOTES “ that function good enough for the common user. If you really want great performance from your document programs install “NAUNCE DRAGON” dictation services. Even the getting more expensive all the time “MICROSOFT WORD” begs for an installation of DRAGON dictation apps.

I’ve been using cloud storage services for 14 years (since Dropbox started) In that time, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by many newcomers to the market. I would recommend my top 3 cloud services to anyone. My mid tier cloud services are functional and have interesting things about them that keep me working with them. However, One Drive ranks dead last and I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy.

1. Box
2. Dropbox
3. Google Drive

4. PCloud

6. All other cloud services

7. Microsoft’s One Drive

So why is Microsoft One Drive so bad? Because it has never worked properly on any of the Macs at our creative agency, All the other cloud services get it right, but One Drive struggles. Below are just a few of the reasons One Drive is awful:

- Hogs CPU
It doesn’t run quietly in the background and will slow your machine to a crawl causing other apps to crash as your laptop fan works overtime to support One Drive.

- It stops syncing without alerting you. So you’ll never know if your phone and laptop are AC try ally syncing files.

- It struggles with names and file types

- buggy and crashes all the time.

- honestly I have to reinstall it every few weeks just so it will work again.

I first downloaded this app to transfer and access files through my phone and computer, as well as generally store files. My icloud storage was months past full. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of selecting camera upload (when you have it off, there is a constant message nagging you to enable it) The upload lasted hours, and I couldn't turn it off until it was complete. My phone became laggy. Then, at the last three huge files, some videos, the camera upload got stuck. Every minute or so, one of those files would finish uploading, then OneDrive would say its storage was full; it would delete that file and try again to upload it. I couldn't turn this off. To get it working, I deleted a bunch of files from my phone and their pairs on onedrive. Finally, the three videos uploaded, and OneDrive was pleased to announce ""Your storage is full. Please click to upgrade"" or something like that.

Soon after, I discovered that Adobe Creative Cloud (which I have) allows 100 GB. I moved all of my photos and videos from my phone, computer, and google storage, to Lightroom. But now, for some reason, I CANNOT DELETE MY PHOTOS FROM ICLOUD. Whether on my phone or computer, files will magically reappear after being deleted. I may have successfully deleted some, but I cannot tell. Yes, I have camera upload turned off. Also, I have to constantly tell it to please not upload the photos on my computer. On my computer, I contantly get the ""Your OneDrive is full. Please pay us."" message. 

Also, it's difficult to access non-photo files from the phone app.

4894,2017-12-23 12:26:54,"The TL;DR here is that the file management with the OneDrive app is terrible, and they don’t even try to integrate with iOS features which makes it a frustrating user experience. 

I get a lot of OneDrive space because I have to pay for Office, so I want to keep using OneDrive. But their terrible iOS app makes me think it’s not worth the savings and I should just get any other 3rd party cloud files service/app. And the MS response on the various support forums to the many users complaining about this is usually a cookie-cutter dismissive answer that doesn’t address the question and is disrespectful to user concerns.

It’s been months and every other cloud provider has supported the Files app except OneDrive. Even if you don’t want to use the Files app, this means you can’t use OneDrive as a location for other apps that do fully support Files app integration except as a basic pop up with limited functionality. So basically there is no effort at integration with iOS in general. 

The two icons that allow you to pick your file view would appear to be for list- and icon-view, but in fact, there is no list-view. There is an icon-view and there is a column-view. The latter has 2 or 3 columns (for portrait and landscape mode) with the date and size listed under the filename. This makes it hard to find the files you want because you have to scan side to side and down, instead of just down. 
A list-view would have one item per line and each file attribute would have its own column, with preferably more/customizable attributes than just date/time and size available.  And the files should be sortable by each attribute in a nested fashion. There is plenty of screen real-estate on the iPad to allow this. It is fine if the developers don't want to use the ui I just mentioned, but they should somehow allow for that functionality, or they deserve 1-star reviews.
Also, being able to bookmark/favorite files and folders would be an obvious improvement. These features have been established as necessary for file browsers many years ago. There's is no reason to omit them on iOS.",1,False,DannyGGGT,"Not good for file management, and doesn’t support system features.","{'id': 2441531, 'body': ""Hi there!

“Your files are being unfrozen. This may take up to 24 hours.” (Or something like that.)

Cool. I signed back in to check it out. There were four items:
• Two empty folders (I forget the names)
• One empty personal vault 
• A PDF entitled “Getting Started with OneDrive”

All four of these were default items. All four created as part of the account, and had nothing to do with me.

I subscribed to OneDrive’s premium service, hoping that I could seamlessly sync files between my devices, including photos from iOS devices. I followed every step instructed , in including enabling camera upload. After waiting patiently for a few hours, photos simply won’t be uploaded automatically to OneDrive!

I tried researching online to troubleshoot , but none of those blog post’s suggestions worked. I tried clearing cache, adjust photos setting  ... been a few hours but still, NOT a single photo was backed up.

So I did a bit of research - as it turns out many other users experienced the same problems ! I wish I read those reviews earlier, which would have saved me hours. I wish I could have full refund. The money could have been spent on a better cloud storage solution! 

After failing to get the app to sync photos to OneDrive , I was thinking to upload by folders or by selecting multiple photos. To my surprise, this app wouldn’t even allow multiple photos upload — one can’t even select photos on the camera roll/album and perform batch upload to OneDrive !! What a shame! Even an amateur app could enable multiple file upload to a server!

I have lost files and hundreds of hours of productivity due to OneDrive for Business’ deficiencies and poor quality. Examples:

• OneDrive arbitrarily deleted more than 5,000 files to the Trash
• File saves in Excel appear to save to the Cloud, but they actually do not, so changes and work productivity are lost. This happens on files as small as ~400 KB for any on demand files.
• Excel files will not open when selected in File Explorer or Excel on the desktop, you can only open the file using a web browser version of the application.
• Excel files will save at a given filename length, but cannot be opened at the same filename length. Filenames of the same length will open in other Office applications on the desktop, but not Excel. Excel filenames typically have to be 4-5 characters shorter in length than for other Office applications in order to open on the desktop.
• Most of the above are known, reported problems that have yet to be fixed by Microsoft.

Bottom line: OneDrive is not a trustworthy or reliable application for file storage.

Photo's are dumped into one big pile, all names changed to nothing you will recognize but, in date order. So if you're trying to compile a few albums, good luck even finding a few of the pics you want. There's no uploading to a specific album. It's dump them in the pile and then compile an album. I must really be stupid, this isn't the way I'd approach this functionality. Nor would Adobe. Who, last I heard, has some experience with photography. Nor did Apple until Steve departed. I guess he was just as dumb as we are -- in the eyes of Apple, Google and MS. 

My journey was to replace Apple Photo's with a product that allowed albums to be sorted by something other than the last pic moved into an album. Tried Google, it's even more limited. Tried MS, it's very poorly executed by people who know nothing about photography or the simple execution steps needed to compile some on-line photo albums. And have no inclination to ask someone who does. All these folks are following what Yahoo! did for years as it destroyed its business. Grab your popcorn now.",1,False,xgh,Reviewed for photos only,

Microsoft is doing a good job, in my opinion, of negotiating a space where the customer can feel secure (I'll be plain: because it's free) to try out cloud-based storage. If you find that you need more than what they offer, you can opt to purchase more. There are other storage options, but the cloud suits my needs as a college instructor who has to move from class to class.

The app itself is gorgeous, and since I do most of my actual instruction work on classroom PC's, it serves well as a way to review material.

My only gripe is the move to subscription based access to Microsoft Office products. Some very important and fairly basic functions are being held for ransom in each of the latest mobile and web-based apps, including Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. You can get the added functionality of, say, your favorite transition in PowerPoint, for a price. And then you'll pay that price every month for as long as you might need the use of transitions and word-art. It's the same economic principles at work behind the pricing structure of ""freemium gaming,"" applied to a professional product...er...subscription. In my opinion, it's a weird way to sell this kind of software. These programs are creative and professional tools that expand and often surpass the traditional spaces and methods available for communicating data and ideas. As such, they are a communicative tool. One wouldn't require a subscription to use a typewriter, now would they?",5,False,Johnny Jounce,"Cloud 9, baby!",

    So far so good, as of right now it is a five-star app and I have changed my star rating accordingly!

(Old Review)
I really love the one drive, it's actually pretty cool. With that said, I am really disappointed in the iPad app. It is really buggy! As it is right now you cannot use it while in landscape mode. There is a huge black bar on the right side and you cannot see any of the user interface icons on the bottom of the screen. They are completely cut off, that is until you rotate the iPad to portrait mode and even then the area of the screen is not maximized to its fullest potential! Don't even get me started on the order it uploads and automatically arranges photos, it's all kinds of scrambled! I should be able to move and rearrange my docs and photos easily, with this app, guess again! This is a really really poor showing for an extremely awesome service. The creators of the iPad app should really be ashamed of themselves! Did they even beta-test this app before they released it? Needless to say it is in need of some serious overhaul!

5041,2016-04-09 01:35:01,"I've been using OneDrive for 4 years, primarily to have a backup of my most important files available immediately on another machine if the computer I'm working on were to crash. It's been a dependable addition, allowing me to feel confident I won't have to rework something into which I may have put a good deal of time. The only problem I had in the four years came not from anything to do with the program, but from a failing hard drive on each of two computers in a period of about a year. It seems the issues associated with that event would occasionally clear a part of the drive where a folder for OneDrive is located and the app would see it as a change made and delete from all devices. That's what a program like this was intended to do, so again, it works as it should. From my experience, I would suggest to others they only use the 'Always On' feature on a single machine if they are in need of sync throughout each day but to avoid doing so on more than one. Again, it's not a flaw in the service, just the chance we take with technology and Murphy's Law.

5042,2017-06-02 14:08:29,"Microsoft definitely makes the best document apps. I love using one drive to store my Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents. Couple small things that I would like to see addressed. There are two default folders that I do not have any use for, but they cannot be deleted. The ""Documents"" folder and the ""Email attachments"" folder remain empty for me. I never use them, but they are always there. I've tried to delete them, but they reappear after I restart the app. Seems like an easy fix if you allow users to toggle this feature in the settings rather than default it for everyone.

The other small issue I have is will the numerical sorting of documents. Only the first number of a two digit number is registered when arranging documents. For example, this results in a document titled ""Chapter 12"" to be listed BEFORE a document titled ""Chapter 2."" Again, an easy fix if you just allow the arranging algorithm to account for all digits comprising a number instead of ONLY the first digit. Then documents with numbers will be sorted more intuitively.

There seems to be hope. Since they've been making updates I do feel optimistic about this app's future. I've not expected things from it for such a while that I've basically accepted its limitations and just try to go from there. I tried some time ago to use this with my PC but it was so stupid with one pic at a time I popped that one nerve right passed the most aggravated I could get and haven't even thought of trying it again. There's nothing I can do if this app stays the way it is other than to grin and bear it. Oh yeah and accept what there is of it to work with and move on.

5044,2015-04-13 11:50:17,"OneDrive didn't seem to know when the photos I uploaded were actually taken; pictures and screenshots I had saved over the course of several months were jumbled together and sorted under the day I uploaded them, rather than when they were taken. I also couldn't find the pictures I had most recently taken in the Photos section, despite Camera Backup saying all new photos had been uploaded. I uploaded photos several times since March 31, but OneDrive kept showing me was the most recent date of photos being taken. The files were actually named beginning with the dates they were taken, but in Photos, there's no way to sort by name.

In an effort to reorganize everything, I had turned off Camera Backup and deleted all the photos I had stored. When I turned it back on, after having cleared my recycle bin in browser (since there's no option for that in the app, and I'm not wasting another hour trying to manually select over 700 photos for individual deletion), it tells me all the photos have already been uploaded. And while that's technically true, I have no idea how to ""reset"" Camera Backup so that it'll start over again.

My family has 9 iOS devices and take thousands of photos.  To make sure we're backing up pictures correctly, I wrote a Python script that would gather the contents of everyone's PhotoStream folder on their PC and synchronize them to our home file server.  The iCloud Control Panel 3.0 update a while back broke that as nearly 50% of the photos sent to PhotoStream never synchronized down to the PCs.  This is a well known bug. I switched to using OneDrive and the Camera Roll auto-backup function and local OneDrive PC folders for my script and have not missed a single photo.  I suppose it is not surprising that Microsoft wrote a better PC app than Apple, but quite surprising that their iOS software is so good as well.  Important documents are always with me with OneDrive, and pairing it with OneNote makes for a powerful note taking and records App that again follows me across devices and PCs.

Ever since Microsoft reduced the amount of storage down to 5GB due to accounts abusing their paid unlimited storage, it's been impossible to use this service to save music, photos, and videos, without coming across the message that your available storage is running low.

I'm in college and I do not have the money to be spending on a cloud service with not enough space to begin with, ESPECIALLY when there are better cloud services out there, as mentioned in the title.

Does this mean that this app is bad?
No. It's great.
No bugs I can find. The app built with a great interface. It cooperates decently with other Microsoft apps like OneNote or Microsoft presentations.

OneDrive in my opinion let you do the most and is compatible with more apps and devices, where iCloud is my Home cloud cause I own an IPhone 6s Plus but I prefer OneDrive and I basically turn iCloud off and only activate it occasionally to do a backup of so if something bad was to happen I have a recent backup. But I use OneDrive and Google Photos for everything else. Sorry OneDrive but you can't beat free unlimited storage on high definition pictures and video especially with all these phones that have such high quality cams and also I have a GoPro Hero4 Black Edition.   Dropbox is cool and has good features but you get like 1GB free for downloading the app which is stupid but I use it cause it is easier to use on certain apps then OneDrive which is rare but you can't be perfect. I love all the free memory OneDrive gives you with email accounts and Microsoft devices. I don't know what I am gonna do when my two years run out this March on my free 250gb of free space cause I'm pretty sure I'm using a good chunk. Time to spring clean the cloud. Hahah thank you OneDrive and if you are trying to find out which cloud will work best for you I would say OneDrive and Dropbox and Google Photos will serve all your needs and then some. Unfortunately not just one cloud can serve everything these days there is just to much data and to much demand for different UI that makes it impossible and that's why I use those three. OneDrive for all important files so I can sync across all devices.

When I open the app, it always (not an exaggeration,) tells me that there is a problem with my login, and asks me to log in again (If this were due to a session expiration, I could understand and would appreciate the level of security, but alas, this is not the case,) and then after I have entered my credentials, asks me whether the account that I logged into is, in fact the account that I wanted to log into, and then asks me to enter my password AGAIN. If I open a file through the app, it opens the appropriate app to edit or view the document, I have to type in my password. Then, it asks if the account that I typed credentials for is the account that I wanted, and asks for me to enter my credentials YET AGAIN (ever read something, and wonder whether it was just copied and pasted in error? Not this time.)

Lately, because I had been putting up with all of the above without posting a negative review (because, despite all of the hoops, I could get my files,) the app has gotten into the habit of asking me to enter my password, and then asking me to enter my password without any indication that there was something wrong with the earlier attempt. After closing the app, re-opening the app, trying again, closing the app, re-opening the app, trying again, closing Onedrive, opening the app directly, trying to get to the files (I can at least see the folders in the Onedrive app,) and running into the same insane loop, I gave up trying to access my files, and decided to spend the time that I should be using to update that file, writing this review.

5 Free device syncs!
Discovers files from your entire pc/phone/tablet/i-device/kindle, and will let you select what to import.
Or, you could automatically import all documents, pictures, music files, whatever's on your devise using up all of your precious/vital/ costly storage.
On your phone, you can sync your account, and of course.. automatically have your stored data. Plus, get rid of all that data your pictures add up to. Yeah, the cloud, and sky drives are fair; (Cute, honestly.)..
But, this!.. This people, truly is, ""THE creme de l'creme of data storage and portable availability!"".

Truly, this app., has to be better than the invention of squirtable cheese!!!

Got tired of data plans, flash drives, external hard drives...
This, could potentially be the greatest thing!!
As previously stated, I discovered online. Now, my data plans can be laid to rest. Though, not in vein! Thus, for the mighty power of that one click to end your subscription.. brings joy to the dusty gap in your wallet once more.

To be honest, I hardly write reviews for the products and developments I use, but I absolutely felt the Microsoft applications have garnered enough merit in my interaction with their interfaces to be addressed and applauded. 

First off, the only piece of technology I own that is not under the umbrella of Microsoft products is my iPhone, simply because it came with my Verizon Family plan, and even so I plan on switching to a Microsoft phone when I'm finally able to use an upgrade that's not given to my daughter after she goofs (drops hers in toilet, leaves it on the roof of her car, takes off her case so it can fit in her pockets...you parents know the drill). 

In other words, I'm indeed a big fan of Microsoft.

With that I must say:

 I'm extremely impressed at both Microsoft for developing an incredibly easy to use, relief-insinuating development; and Apple for allowing Microsoft to collaborate with their product and continuously keep updates and device compatibility bias-free. 

So yes, this app is an incredible breath of fresh air and a great download for the users of the Microsoft essentials. All of the applications involved have a wonderfully seamless App-to-App compatibility across the board and the interactions are delightfully quick and painless.

I tip my hat to both companies for allowing those of us in such a situation to cross-platform and continue our use in either the way we see fit, or when our temporary placement demands it.

I have used only 35gb of the 1t you get with Office 365 and for me it is a nightmare with 3 computers. If you need quick synchronization and downloads use anything else (I'd avoid iCloud and Google Drive too).  I started using this because it was the only cloud service supported at work. Evidently MS doesn't have the infrastructure and programming to properly support what they are selling. Dropbox download speeds are 4-10X faster than OneDrive. One especially bad problem is that despite claims otherwise you really can't locate your Overdrive folder anywhere you want without using virtual drives which come with their own problems. I have a 256gb SSD and use a 128gb USB 3.0 flash drive to store data including OneDrive. Often the virtual drive disappears which requires remounting and a 15 minute sync even though there have been no changes. It would be great to copy OneDrive to another 3.0 USB drive (8 min for my 35gb) take it to another computer, sync and avoid a long download but OneDrive won't do that. It ignores the exact copy and proceeds to download a copy over 2 days and I'm not using a virtual drive. If you want a better sense of the problem search for OneDrive download or sync issues. Read some of the idiotic workarounds offered by MS. It becomes quite apparent that MS is deeply in over their head.

11479,2015-01-06 01:57:34,"I submitted the following feedback several months ago and nothing has been fixed. 

Judging from feedback from others, Microsoft does not seem to value feedback from their customers. Otherwise this relatively simple fix would have been implemented by now. 

Microsoft - please pay attention to us!

Search was a welcomed feature but not up to par with other cloud apps. 

1. Can't search at a folder level. When you do a search, it searches every file in OneDrive not just the files in the folder you are in. Not good. It should on only search for files in the folder you are in including sub folders and sub folder files. 

2. Search Bar content is not persistent. Example: I enter  text in the search bar and get three search results. I open one of the search result files. Now if I want to look at one of the other search result files, I have to re-enter the search text again. Solution: the search text should remain in the search box until manually deleted  and there should be a way to return to the current results when you are viewing a search result file.

3. Search Crashes - this is reproducible. Do a search from a OneDrive folder, open the file, and then use the back button navigation to return to the OneDrive root directory. It consistently crashes the app.

Other suggestions

This app needs a third view for files - List View. The existing views (i.e., thumbnail & detail take up too much real estate on the screen and don't allow you too see the entire filename.  A List view would let you see more files on the screen without scrolling.",1,False,Cappy Lee,Search and Crash,

11539,2016-09-14 10:56:43,"When it works this is a great app. The ability to access files and photos across devices is a great invention. I run a small sales organization. Having the ability to upload product manuals and brochures as well as customer data to one drive and then have it instantly available on my iPad or iPhone or notebook computer is fantastic! The problem is that the upload feature is not 100% reliable. Yesterday I uploaded ten new PDFs files to one drive using my notebook running Windows  7. Later in the day I needed to use them on my iPad but the files were no where to be found. Last evening when I returned to my office one drive on the PC reported that it was still syncing these latest files. I ran ""Sync Now"" but as of this morning the files are still missing in the cloud.

When Microsoft gets the bugs ironed out this will be a great app. Until then be careful!

March 31, 2016 update: Rather getting better, this app keeps getting worse! It keeps asking me to log in them when I do it tells me that I do not have authority to access the files I wrote and uploaded. A total waste of my time!

July 17,,2016 update: Yesterday I checked in on a folder that I had named ""Archive"" back in April, 2015. At that time relying on the promises of Microsoft to keep my files safe, I placed hundreds of files on OneDrive for Business. Well, my trust in Microsoft
 was totally unfounded. Haunt reds of these files are missing! 

I reported the issue to Microsoft Support. To begin with the lady I am dealing with has a wicked Indian English accent and then speaks much too fast. She is very hard to understand. So if you use this app, pray that you do not have to talk to the Indian support people.

Second of all this lady either is dense or else normal American English idiom is beyond her. I had to explain everything several times. And then when she sends me a follow up email I had to correct several points.

I hope I can find these historical files on some old hard drive. I don't have any faith that Microsoft can or will find these files. And the real question is why were they deleted in the first place? My small company has several Office 365 licenses that have storage available on OneDrive for Business. 

Net, net: Do NOT put anything on OneDrive that you can not afford to lose. If I could give You neDrive for Business a lower grade I would.
July 29, 2016 update: well a new low! A person from Microsoft purporting to be a manager promised to check technical details and call me back this morning between 9 and 10 Eastern Time this morning. Well it is now 5:14 PM and no call. My files are still lost in the ether...hundreds of them!

September 15, 2016 update: in August I found a backup hard disk and reloaded my old files to OneDrive. Yesterday I needed to refer to one. It was missing as were hundreds of others. The directory structure was intact but the directories were mostly empty.",1,False,BoltonBob,Beware! OneDrive for Business loses your data!,

11968,2024-05-10 13:41:21,"Let me give you a hypothetical. Your coworker wasn’t able to make it to a meeting, and asked you to record it (and we’re assuming that everyone in the meeting has consented to being recorded). You use your personal device to record a video so said coworker can see the slides and everything. But you can’t send it as an email because the meeting is long and the video file is too hefty. So you decide, “oh, I’ll upload it to my work OneDrive and then send the file that way.” So you download the OneDrive app, go to photos, and try to upload it. But the app requires that if you want to upload ANY of your photos and videos, you have to upload ALL of them.
There are multiple issues with this. First, many people have photos on their phones that they don’t want other people to see, or would prefer to keep off of a work-managed email account. Second, even if you have no photos that you care about keeping private, you can’t prioritize which files are uploaded first, and while this isn’t a problem if you’re just trying to upload an photo because it starts from the most recent photo in your library, if you’re trying to upload a video, you have to wait for all of your photos to download before it even starts working on the videos.
Some of the issues here could presumably be circumvented by simply tampering with your settings (i.e. if you went into Settings > OneDrive > Photos > Limited Access), but the app refuses to acknowledge that it has any Photo library access unless Full Access is turned on.
This is absolutely baffling design that is not customer friendly at all, but the fact that it seems to be intentional makes it even more frustrating.
Summary: The app actively hindered me from being able to complete a simple process quickly. As for my other complaints, I haven’t used any of the app’s other features, but the layout is not easy-to-use in my opinion (as is the case with most things associated with Outlook).

Sometimes after several minutes.  Doesn’t happen on my Android phone, doesn’t happen on PC.  Only iOS is it this bad.

Furthermore, the image editor is nice, except tapping and dragging anything tries to move the popup window as well as interact with what you’re doing.  Cropping is difficult when you’re trying to drag the border, only to have it also try to move the window… except said window can’t be moved so it bounces back into the center.  It’s even HARDER to do this when the app wants to crash.

I’d love to explore the files on my OneDrive to save them to my iPad as-needed.  Can’t access files directly in other apps, but again - I can’t really do that when the app decides to crash if I so much as decide to breathe.

For what it’s worth - I’ve tried reinstalling the app, rebooting the iPad, and yes - I even reset the iPad, all just to see if it’s on my end, and sure enough - it does nothing.  Funny enough, RIGHT before I decided to finally review and rate this app, there was an app or various bug fixes and stability improvements.  Not even 30 seconds after re-opening this app, guessed what happened?  It crashed!  😂

11992,2023-03-29 00:41:04,"Love the app but Microsoft has the tools to make the photo library much more intuitive and accessible. People are storing decades worth of photos nowadays and the photo library NEEDS a better search function. OpenAI has the capabilities to return accurate photos for queries such as “Show me pictures of the art museum I went to last year in New York”, or “show me pictures of the Frank Ocean concert I attended in 2008”, or “show me photos of the family reunion that took place in 2001 sometime.”

Photos are one of the most treasured digital assets an individual can own, sort of like a music library on Spotify because they are deeply personal things. They provide provoked emotion and reminders of why life is beautiful. They’re platforms to share how you view the world.

Why not use innovative AI models to make photo libraries a better memory recall aide in social situations, or to revisit moments without having to spend 10-20minutes scrolling and “date fishing”. It would be easier to search “show me photos of blue kayaks”, and OneDrive would return the photos you took in your blue kayak sometime in 2006. The search function as it is now DOES utilize some of this functionality, although it is VERY limited and not accessible to people who don’t know how to use these functions effectively. 
I tested this by searching “Trip to Alaska” in the photo library. None of the photos from my Alaska trip last month were recalled. More interestingly, completely unrelated and out-of-context photos were recalled.

I decided that OneDrive wasn't as satisfactory, nor as user-friendly as Google Drive for what I was using it for, but adequate for something else, so I went to delete the stuff I no longer needed on it.  Boy.  There was no <SELECT ALL>, so I had to move hundreds of files  into the Recycle Bin one by one.

1) add select all, delete all in the recycle bin... when I have above 100-700 photos to be deleted , it is just waste of time to select them one by one. Sometime, I can use sliding my finger over the photos but that feature doesn’t work all the time. It works by luck few seconds.

2) add delete option to the albums, it only has remove from albums.. sometimes I ran into a photo that needs to be sent to the trash and I can’t do that, it is hard to locate it if i just removed from the album. 

3)improve the photo location, It does not recognize some states or countries. Again it is hard for me to locate some photos or use the city/state or country as a quick reference . 

4) improve the search feature like the search in the photos in the iphone. Like : yellow, clouds, kids, water..etc... one drive can show a minimum search words unlike the iphone/apple which gives me hard time to give up that feature, yet I want to be a loyal customer to you as long as I live.

Fix issues like - turning on Camera upload on iOS for someone already using iCloud, just uploads thumbnails of the pictures.

Apple keeps a low quality copy of the photo, who wants to back that up? 🤷🏻‍♂️

B - Despite having the most recent iOS, using an iPhone 8 with the highest storage capacity and Ram available …. the OneDrive App always crashes and must be reopened. As noted above, while organizing my folders and moving images ONE BY ONE, after about 15 moves, the app crashes and I must reopen. VERY ANNOYING!!
C - It has issues when I have a folder open with a LOT of images in it and often crashes before I can view the entire contents (why I am working on sub-categorizing them).

The reason I chose to pay a monthly fee for the amount of storage space I have was because my desktop computer was dying.  It had a 1tb hard drive and I prayed I could get everything uploaded to my OneDrive before it died. 

** HOWEVER, OneDrive had issues with that as well. I was not using a wifi connection and my computer (once I got it to boot up) had no issues). First, I found that if I chose a folder with too much content, it would error out during the upload and just get stuck. The pattern in which the files upload (not in a specific order) created a big issue as I had to go folder by folder and compare each to see what was missing. After the first round of this, I made sure that when uploading I did NOTHING else on the computer. I also made a point of being careful when I selected a folder and set it to upload, keeping a limit on the ‘total contents’ (# of files and total kb) so it would not ‘error out’ before finishing, but so I could set it to go and walk away while it worked. 
I “thought” that had solved things because when I would check on uploads they showed ‘complete’ and I would start another. After 2 days of working hard on this I noticed the ‘file sizes’ didn’t match up. After following a trail to see what was the issue I realized that your OneDrive Coding isn’t written in a manner to upload multiple levels of sub folders within a group. For each main folder I selected, it would upload the group on sub folders within and their ‘names’ but they were left empty. Their contents was not uploaded. 
It was a freaking mess and I ended up deleting hundreds of mb and hours upon hours of uploads and starting over. The entire process was RIDICULOUSLY tedious and I had to be practically glued to my computer to tell it to upload folder after folder to be sure I had everything. 
I spent a couple weeks doing what should have been much simpler because I knew that if shut off my computer or let it go into sleep mode, I was taking a chance that when I tried to wake it it reboot, I may get the black screen of death and would have to enter BIOS and hope I could get it to boot. I ‘believe’ I managed to get all my documents and photos into my OneDrive storage, but it took much more time and effort than it should have. I had to chose a cloud option because I knew I could not put a priority on replacing my computer immediately and needed to be able to access all files from my iPhone or iPad. Neither have the ability to access data they a flash drive, that type of storage would not have allowed me access to things I needed during this transition time (and are also not windows based). 

I’m selling my house and relocating this summer.  Once that process is done I will invest in a new desktop system. I sincerely hope by sharing this that maybe your team can code your program better and it will be easier when I need to reverse the process and DOWNLOAD the files from OneDrive onto my new system.

OneDrive was a great product I was more than willing to sub 365 for it and Office. Now there is zero benefit. Win10 and soon Win11 harvest far too much personal info, added they are attempting to force out local acct usage. And getting in bed with Amazon, suspect a backend personal data sharing partnership there. Office just as bad for privacy violations and can be replace with Libre, as just one alternative. That left OneDrive. First when moving my collection of music and videos, ~10% of them were corrupted online, no error correction or warning. Many more appeared to have never made the transfer and just disappeared. Saved by having backups for most and the original media where not backed up. Second, the privacy policy was not specific enough about if they troll my files to target ad or resell last I looked, I moved all files except non-sensitive or important everywhere use back to my local storage. Finding all the various privacy switches to disable or limit information collection and sharing is a hassle. Third, now it seems I am constantly creating 3rd party passwords for all connected apps and devices over and over. Once fine, but several times.

This process must be repeated for the many hundreds of duplicate files. Their tech support was no help. First they had me go to my iPhone settings and press “clear cache” for the OneDrive app. That did not work.

Why no systemwide sorting?

Why each folder has its own sorting that I did not choose..!?

Please make thumbnails view available systemwide with one setting.

Also make order by name systemwide available.

The folders have their own order which I did not choose.

On the Mac and online they all have the same order but on the iPhone app some folders have arranged differently..!

Kindly understand that some people want to have all their files and folders in thumbnail view and right now there is no way to do that..!

Solved Issue:

Sharing option chooses “can edit” by default and there is no way to change it to “view only” unless you remove access and before sharing choose an email so during this you can choose “view only”.

The problem is I want to have the link created by default for “view only” without the option of having the recipient’s email since I may want to send the link using iMessage instead of email..!

The one problem that I found is that if you select thumbnail view it only stays that way for the folder you are in at that time and it does not change throughout the entire cloud.

All of the other competitors such as Apple iCloud and Google Drive has the opposite..!

Solved Issue:

UPDATE: (Sun • 08.06.17)

Every Update Proves Makes This App Worse And Worse & My Contempt Higher & Higher! What is so insulting is that you keep #1 wasting our time with updates that continually do NOT work. But maybe even worse, #2 you keep users hoping that with each update will come a fix, or, dare I say, functionality as this app at least once had until the morons there decided to push through 'added features' which I see NONE, as the core app still is non-functional! How is this progress from the all mighty progressive Microsoft? If I even THOUGHT of smearing my company's service or product in such a haphazard and careless manner, I wouldn't even have to wonder as it's certain what would occur, as is the case with 95% of most businesses with accountability. I held on last time in one last ditched effort at hope, but this will never stop from your sorry excuse of existence across the board with all of your products, possibly with the exception of XBOX, but with time, I'm sure you will destroy that as well! Adios!

ORIGINAL: (Sun • 07.30.17)

This was once my go to Cloud app, especially once my included subscription of 1 year included with MS Office had expired. First of all, I was once at a total free account storage of 15GB due to referrals and different incentives to promote their product once it was launched. Not one mention of this would be possible to keep or maintain if I didn't purchase a subscription plan, it simply stated, since I had uploaded over 200GB data with the 1TB plan offered with MS Office, that if I didn't purchase a subscription plan, they would leave open for only a couple of weeks until the account would, #1 NOT be brought back down to the 15GB base account storage I had complied with accumulating and doing with helping do my agreed service to promote, but down to the overall base of the new account 5GB amount. Furthermore, and #2, being as how I assumed, my first mistake, that the size of Microsoft surely wouldn't delete my data if I didn't extend a premium subscription, but rather bump me down to at least 50GB as I didn't expect to keep what I had, but then completely fly past the already earned and offered 15GB while saying we apologize but all accounts, even promoted accounts where storage had been bumped above the 5GB would be no longer honored and placed back at 5GB, & any data over those limits would be deleted. So, as bad as a taste this left in my mouth, & ENTIRELY because I was at that moment satisfied with the OneDrive iOS app and its functionality... once again, ENTIRELY because of this app, I moved forward with another year not only with the Cloud services., but MS Office as well. 

Now, moving forward to the week after I purchased another subscription keeping me at the 1TB plan, the lack of functionality and responsibility to provide this after basically forcing me to do pay, I have not had the ability to upload photos, properly create shares or URL links via the app, or any other function, let alone these all great mighty and wonderful new features I hear about with not one micron showing different other than a once useful app destroyed and my final straw with MS forever tainted. There is simply NO USE without the app crashing and the same process repeating itself over and over with mostly nothing EVER seemingly improving, other than POSSIBLY, & ONLY after leaving it open, sucking down ALL battery life and taking any amount of time with NO indication of it working in background, MAYBE one or two photos showing in process, after crashing and restarting. And MS, you say our feedback is crucial? How? What are you doing with it? It doesn't take an entire genius to see either you guys are completely incompetent, could careless, or, since I see you aren't the brightest in the world, you realize using a Windows Phone with your app and not understanding why it's not functional on iOS doesn't work right? You have to actually use an iOS device for feedback of your own or, well, maybe that's too black and white of an example?

I've TRIED EVERYTHING... I've deleted the app, reinstalled, and even gone into iOS settings down to the OneDrive account options to completely reset all/any settings from the inside out so as to forget the app, my account, & try again as if it hadn't ever been installed on any of the devices I did this method. What do you think happened? Yep, if possible it got even worse and hasn't discovered all photos, or really any from the date the last version of this app actually worked for me, being June 5th. UNACCEPTABLE ACROSS THE BOARD!!! 

When I learned that all of my data would be deleted if I didn't obtain a paid subscription, as well as reading how and in what manner this was communicated to me, I lost all possible paths to pushing this behind me then. They were no longer going to honor any, let alone all as they should, of the agreed upon stipulations of my increased base of 15GB. As a matter of fact, I'm going with my gut now before I experience any more headache. Dropbox allows you to maintain your account even without a paid subscription! They have earned my respect and now my business as Microsoft is a constant disappointment and source to my anger and issues with them all down the spectrum. So fix it or don't, actually don't, then maybe you will get out of this business because your tactics and prior business models will not be upheld and hold water in this industry.",1,False,CHRIS ROSS™,Same Issues Arising Without Fixing,

I like that I can use this cloud account to send links to large documents and videos and then text that link through iMessage to people. MS categorizes my pictures well-enough automatically and I can always go online to put them in better categories if I want to. I configure OneDrive to upload only when I'm on WiFi to save on cellular costs. My suggestion might be to be able to select a folder better on upload, but that's about it. 

There's a nice integration with MS Office Lens too. OneDrive will accept the output of Office Lens and then send it up to your account. As a teacher I get lots of flyers and notices that clutter my life. Now I can easily snap a clean picture of notices, documents I sign that I don't get a receipt for, forms I have to submit that I want to prove I sent in on time, and I know if I have to refer to them, that they're always available to me on my phone or online. 

Just to briefly mention, I love the Focused Inbox in Outlook. I use it just for my main work email accounts and my main personal account. It is so good at alerting me to just the important messages. This all gets echoed through my Apple Watch so I don't miss the important messages.

12504,2017-02-13 02:29:27,"OneDrive along with my Office365 family account is the best value subscription service I have. In particular to OneDrive, I think it provides so much value with its photo backup features on my iPhone and previously my Samsung galaxy, my Amazon Fire tablet and my Windows computer for not only photos, but file too. Microsoft has done a great job with their application integration in their Office programs where I can access any of my files I've been working on from any of my devices that have their software installed.

One brilliant feature of OneDrive is its indexing and searching features to find pictures of things you might be looking for but can't really remember where you stored them. Say for instance you want to find pictures of the pool party your kids were at last year, you can search for ""pool"" and most likely get photos of pictures with pools in them. Really cool. Also, they have OCR recognition of photographed pictures so you can search for key words within the files to find docs. This also worked with regular word, excel, PDF and other files.

My only gripe with OneDrive on iPhone is that I sometimes find that my photos haven't automatically backed up. I have to go into the upload section so they can start. I didn't have this issue on my Samsung. I also notice this happens on my wife's iPhone 6S. Please fix this Microsoft!

I'm also hoping that Microsoft can increase their backup to more than 1TB. 

Overall, I'm happy with Microsoft and what they've been doing in the app space. Not sure people realize the significance in that the world's largest software company is putting out apps, really good ones, for very little cost and many free (see office lens).

Unfortunately the OneDrive for iOS app is the weakest part of the deal. Here’s why:

1. It’s slow. It ponderously loads directories and isn’t nearly as fast as the apps for Dropbox, Sugarsync or Google Drive. Once you open a file it’s slower to download than those apps as well.

2. OneDrive gives you the choice of a Thumbnail View or Details View. How about a column view? I just want an alphabetized list of files in each directory. The two views include extraneous visual information that is slower to load and makes it harder to find files by name.

3. Good grief, Microsoft- this isn’t 2003. Let us open Office files on our OneDrive with any app we want!

12640,2014-02-21 18:47:31,"In the short time I've been using this app I can already vouch for how easy and intuitive it is to use. It's also very reliable. I use GoogleDrive, DropBox, and Box. Majority of the time, for the last 3 years actually, I've just been using Dropbox. So I know my way around cloud storage solutions. I know there are plenty of others out there but I don't want to keep track of all of them. Using OneDrive so far already has me using Dropbox less and less. Camera upload allows me to upload pictures at full size as well as videos. Something Dropbox can do as well except OneDrive allows me to upload videos over cellular network whereas Dropbox does not. Also I like how OneDrive displays the proper formatting of the videos, which is .mp4 whereas Dropbox puts them as .mov for some reason. Also loading pictures and videos on OneDrive is fast and clear, especially when viewing videos. Videos are clear and crisp and don't take forever to load or lag when I skip ahead or rewind. Dropbox unfortunately has poor quality when viewing videos and they take longer than usual to load. I'm always on a fast connection 15-30 Mbps download and a steady 5 Mbps upload. OneDrive also loads up .pdf's other documents fast while Dropbox takes a while to load them. I can honestly say I don't use Microsoft products at all but recently they've been stepping up their game and I think this is proof of it. The app is very well written considering its on iOS. A few things I would like to see are: 1.) Be able to create a folder while moving pictures into a that said folder instead of having to create the folder first then going back to select the images or files to be moved into the folder 2.) Have an option to put a separate pass code on the app like how Dropbox has implemented. You can never be too secure about your files.

12641,2014-01-30 09:06:22,"First off, I absolutely love SkyDrive! It is hands down the best cloud storage service out there! However, there is one thing that absolutely drives me nuts, and that is the inability to create a new folder when uploading a file to SkyDrive from Safari.

I use SkyDrive to save and access all my information wherever I am, and it does an amazing job at that. When I am browsing the internet on my iPhone and I come across a file I need to save, I just hit ""Open in SkyDrive."" My file pops right up in SkyDrive and I press the Upload button. Up pops the list of existing folders. The only problem is, I just discovered ""Underwater Basket Weaving,"" and I don't have an appropriately titled folder in which to store all the informational PDFs I've found yet. So, instead of simply being able to tap ""Add a New Folder"" and typing ""Underwater Basket Weaving"" and then pressing ""Upload;"" First I must press Back, then I hit Edit, then I press Add Items, and after that I press Create a Folder. Now is the worst part though. Now I have to exit SkyDrive, go back to Safari, find the PDF, press ""Open in SkyDrive"" again, then once SkyDrive opens, I can now press Upload and select my newly created and appropriately named folder. I don't want to rant about this, but for such a simple function to be overlooked seems like a major oversight to me. I have been using SkyDrive since before it was even available on iOS, I was ecstatic when it got an app, and with each new revision on the app, I have been patiently waiting for someone to pickup on this missing functionality, but alas, on the 4th major version, it still is nowhere to be found. This really makes me wonder if it is some kind of iOS limitation, but I am just not sure how it could be. Even better than a new folder button however, would be an Edit button on the upload selection page that would easily allow you to Add, Delete, Rename or Merge folders, but for now I would settle for an Add Folder button. 

I love SkyDrive, but if you could please add this very simple functionality, it would possibly save me a whole 1 to 2 minutes a day, but decades worth of frustration!!! ;-)

It knows it wants users to access their files that they are automatically uploading from their Surface or Windows desktop and want to be able to access... But it's like the weird uncle at the family reunion. This app is just kind of ""there"". It isn't enticing iOS users to want to use Microsoft services or products. It has a design ethos that looks like 2002 Microsoft added some glassy and glossy effects to make it seem modern. In fact it is missing two key usability features: 1) Ability to remain logged in 2) Auto-upload / background upload of Camera Roll photos. I couldn't view photos from my iDevice automatically on my Windows Phone and thus was forced to switch exclusively to iOS, which is a bit sad for Microsoft. Additionally, there is no way to access a mobile web version or iOS version of Office to edit documents from Skydrive, so I have then been forced to spend $16.99 on a competitor's office suite. It seems with this product, Microsoft isn't thinking about cross-platform compatibility and how allowing such standards would enable a ""halo effect"" that could encourage iOS users to switch to, or at least want to use, their products.",2,False,Eirikr1848,Confused Design Ethos - Basic Functionality,

Microsoft just needs to make the website and app more MetroUI like and add some extra Dropbox features and I'll be happy.

HOWEVER I HAVE SEEN OTHER PEOPLE SAYING THIS TOO: 
It is VERY necessary to incorporate a button to allow iPhone users to open the files through other apps, such as iBooks as a PDF file. 
Yes, you can email the document and edit it wherever you send it but it doesn't help if I can't access it from my other apps to make it 
1. More accessible and easy to read and 
2. Able to be saved to my phone 

I understand that Microsoft might have some healthy competition with Mac but if you created this app for iPhone users, you should make it convenient for them as well.

EDIT: The new update is much better, I'm very proud of this app! I never stopped using it but it's a lot easier to upload multiple photos and access the files now. Very pleased, finally receives 5 stars!
