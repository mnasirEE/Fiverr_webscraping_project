This app is a must-have for anyone with many documents to handle, because it is not only very easy to use, but is great for saving your work. You’ll be able to save your work anywhere, whether it’s the overall Onedrive or a specific folder. This app clearly demonstrates the meaning of ‘helpful’ because all of us students always have our work ready to hand in. It’s very easy to create folders and offers fast syncing. The functionality and design is gripping; the app is also free, just like the other office apps. Thanks to the fact that I can manage a single office account over many devices, I never have a problem with uploading assignments. And lastly, Onedrive also allows you to save photos and videos for memories; so why not make a new folder and save all of it there? You can even purchase deals that are very good for the price - a $9.99 monthly home subscription for a family is fantastic as it offers 1 terabyte for 6 family members. Plenty of data for the family. Thank you for proving that you guys are the best, Microsoft. Deserves more than 5 stars.",5,False,Amazing and very reliable!,Freewiseguy,
1,2019-09-08 22:07:36,"This app is second to none. I use my onedrive for everything from college (now uni) to home files. I have something like 4 years and about 300gb of photos and videos backed up which I can access so easily across any of my devices, no matter the platform. One of the best things about Onedrive is how universally accessible it is, but also how well it works and the fabulous functionality it provides. With the recent update to the application interface, it is really easy and pleasant to use. The development team are truly incredible and they really seem to take on the feedback of their users. The app is regularly updated with USEFUL updates not just the usual “bug fixes” or “performance improvements” like every single other app seems to do. 

I have tried using a range of other services such as google drive, ICloud Drive and Dropbox, but onedrive is simply the best in terms of functionality, compatibility and features. For £6.99 per month I get 1tb of storage with full access to the latest Microsoft office applications, which is really handy. 

One final thing to mention is that onedrive is a good idea for photos if you have a windows computer, as photos you upload to onedrive will sync to the photos app in windows, meaning you can see them all seamlessly on your computer.

Big thanks to the team who make Onedrive so truly brilliant!",5,False,Outstanding,Zoltage,

I use it mostly to store all of my photos going back over years and I love so many things about the app. However, there is one issue which is huge for me and I am borderline on switching to another big cloud provider because of it. I checked - they have this feature. I don't want to switch, it's so much work, but this really bugs me. The issue is, for whatever reason some of my older photos (5+ years old) uploaded without the exif data for date created. I don't know why because the correct date shows on the (1yr old WD) hard drive they were uploaded from, via windows 10. I thought ok, they're old photos. The big problem is I can't edit the date the photo was taken on Onedrive. So, very old photos show up in my chronological photo timeline as having been taken this year, because Onedrive assigns their upload date to them. This disorder pains me and makes looking through my photo collection not enjoyable. Please, please add this feature ASAP. I will have to move cloud providers if I can't fix this.",4,False,Please fix this one issue!,AM1258,

The folder files are always a different look to how they looked on the app And in browser, or if on a pc or iOS device. So then caused a little confusion in where I had saved it too. 
Also managed to not save my work when my phone ran out of battery. I tried finding the lost file in last place I used it and the folder I had opened it from, looked through the temp folders etc. By then I had no choice but to sit and redo all the work I had previously completed. Disappointed by some way, I pay a monthly subscription but I think one drive has become too complicated trying to do all things for all apps. 
Also I have a personal one drive that I didn’t mean to share with a group Of colleagues which contained all my personal files. So it is far from bomb proof.

However, this app does not “talk” to the Apple developed Files widget. It also doesn’t show documents in the recent section of the files app. Now this could be Apple or Microsofts end. I have contacted Apple and asked them to look at it but need Microsoft to look into it aswell.

However it is constantly asking me to set up my personal vault, I do this every couple of days, highly annoying when your wanting to save something and you can’t because it is asking you to do something that you have done many many times previously, and you have to start again, once you’ve set it up, again!!!!!!
Personal vault also locks after a time even though you are still actively busy in it, why?  If your busy in this location then it should not be locking. It should only lock when your not busy in it.  If it does this when your busy creating or uploading to it then you have to start again.

9,2018-01-14 22:01:01,"There are many things I dislike about Microsoft office in general and its limitations on iOS:

1) The apps themselves may be free, but the subscription isn’t.
One of my main reasons why I only use office for work is how there is a yearly subscription that has to be paid. Luckily I am not the one needs to worry about paying this, however I am appalled at how normal home users need to pay a subscription and cannot buy the software outright. There are many other apps which can do everything that this range of products can do (and more) which are free or paid for in one purchase (iWork and G Suite for example).

2) Ties you into the office ecosystem through a horrible file system.
When saving a file (like a word document for example) the app defaults to either using your OneDrive (Microsoft’s cheap-expensive version of iCloud) or a terrible iPad file UI. (The app does offer alternative cloud storage solutions but suspiciously DOES NOT include iCloud in this extensive list)

3) The lack of support for iOS features.
Office does a fantastic job of not keeping up to date with the operating systems. The apps feel like they were made for iOS 8 because of their clunky interface and lack of other features like support for iCloud or drag and drop, the latter of which was introduced in iOS 11.",3,False,Avoid office whenever possible,CWainwright26,

They’re all present and accessible from there, but if I try to view the files on my iPhone app they’re not present - even the new folders I created don’t show. Sometimes it takes days for them to appear which is no good to me if I need to access them on the move.

12,2019-04-27 09:08:19,"Works well and it’s very good to have native mac and iOS clients that seem to function as well as their Windows equivalents, however, OneDrive does not remember where you are or were. 
If you use the app or go to it from a share sheet you always have to to start again from the root and go through folder structures - every time. 
This can be tiresome. I work in an organisation and have to regularly change my password, often, OneDrive can’t remember the new password. 
For a couple of weeks I find myself being directed back to the organisation sign in page and then, having to go back from the root folder to upload, copy, edit, save a file etc. 
If MS could solve that and linked sign ins with Word, excel etc that can leave you in a loop of uneditable docs and multiple sign ins, then it would be a beater.
I use OneDrive because I can’t use a native client for anything else on my organisation PC. The fact that it works so well with my Mac at work and at home, my iPad and iPhone is an unexpected benefit and bonus.

In theory, you can select files and folders for offline use, but in practice this is very erratic. You can select files and folders and the little green icon appears next to them, so all looks good, but when you try to use the file without an internet connection, it’s pot-luck whether it works or not. Sometimes with large folders, setting them for use off line fails completely, with no error message - the green icon appears, but the next time you look, it’s gone again.

When i upload a file from desktop or web browser it sometimes takes days before it shows up in my iOS app and vice versa. 
OneDrive is 100% incapable of being able to sync files between two computers. If a file gets updated on machine 1, it uploads and downloads on machine 2, but then machine 2 logs it the original unaltered file as being the modified one, so then machine 2 re-uploads the old file and often overwrites the newer version.

I’m a 365 subscription customer. I made the decision to run my iPhone from my already existing Microsoft account, as not to have to manage yet more services. I have a huge amount of OneDrive storage, so much so that I committed my entire photo & video library to it. One of the stand out features for me of the OneDrive app was the ability to access my library and have the app manage my iPhone photo uploads in the background (as per my previous windows phone). The iCloud photo backup service is disabled. For 13 months (since purchasing my iPhone) I have repeatedly engaged with OneDrive support on the apps inability to upload correctly. Time and time again I’ve been given the same ‘generic’ advice, all of which, quite frankly is aimed at supporting non IT savvy folks. However, I’ve gone through the motions of what’s been asked of me. I have spent countless man hours testing the app, repeated when new versions are released etc. Location changes (required to trigger a background upload) and testing on fibre & ADSL networks. I was able to test on a new/replacement device after my iPhone failed after 6 months, so a good exercise for a ‘ground up’ installation. All of which hasn’t made any difference to the uploading issue. Uploading gets stuck (usually on large MOV files) which requires the app to be physically opened to get things moving again (not really a background process then??). Every conceivable combination of file format and settings have been tried (currently all on ‘compatible’ formats rather than HEIF etc) all to no avail. Everything has been documented in great detail to MicroSoft in an attempt to assist them with the ongoing issue. Only after 12 months has the case been passed on to the OneDrive escalations team, who are now supposedly investigating?? This has at least stopped the repeated ‘generic’ suggestions from their front line support. So, a cautionary tale if you really want a ‘passive’ photo uploading experience!! As suggested above, I’m not really sure that MicroSoft should be promoting this broken feature? I can’t be the only person experiencing this issue globally? MicroSoft are adding lots of great functionality to their app, however, I would rather have the basics working than PDF editing etc. I’m really hopeful that this is fixed but after 13 months I’m not so sure!!",1,False,Background Photo Upload Broken!!,SuperCade,

One drive is great if you only have one business account and email address.
But if you have more than one business account, the one drive app, not the device user, determines which business account is the primary account and we are unable to change the wrongly preselected primary account! This then excludes access to any settings.

We have to log out of one business account to be able to set the other business account as the primary account to be able to access settings and then re-add the deleted business account. 
Once the deleted account is re-added, it asserts itself as the primary account again! WHY?????  What a nightmare!
Just allow the device user to select the primary account ! 

Also where in the feedback we are invited to include a screenshot, if we select the option to include a screenshot, the app automatically includes a random screenshot not of our choice, with no relevance to the feedback we’re providing other than the fact it’s a screenshot from within the one drive app.
Allow access to the relevant part of the app to take a screenshot. 

Also, in photos, to select all photos we have to select individual pictures, there is no “select all” option. So when I discovered that one of my accounts had been backing up photos, I had to select nearly 2000 photos individually to be able to delete them.

1315,2022-02-13 07:19:46,"From a usability standpoint this is possibly the most frustrating news app I have ever used.  It is buggy as hell. 

1) articles can sometimes take ages to appear. Why? because the app is attempting to first load an ad. There can be times when this takes 10, 15, etc seconds — that’s just for the ad to load so that I can either engage with it, or just close it to get on with just reading the article. Sometimes I have to navigate back and navigate a second or third time before the article finally loads. 

2) but the really frustrating part is going for the previous day’s hour-long news program (פספסתם ). Here’s what sometimes happens: click to play, the ads load (ok, that’s acceptable), I sit through the ads (say 30 seconds) and then…..nothing. Just a blank screen. I wait 30 seconds. Nothing. So I go from my iPad mini 6th generation (the latest) to my iPhone 13 pro. Same thing. At that point I give up. And we’re talking news junky (yep, I’m a news junky). 

3) over the past few months, on opening the app, I’ve been getting prompts to update the app. I click OK and this takes me to the App Store. But clearly! No update is taking place because there no wait time while the app is updating…just the usual button to click and open the app. I now just ignore any of these prompts. I reckon, if there’s a real update that’ll just happen since my devices are set up to auto update all apps.

2. Why the OneDrive app does NOT remember the folder sorting options user set? User should be able to set sort by date new to old too ALL folders, or at least to all document type folders. Or at least OneDrive should remember how user set each folder sorting option and list or thumbnails option.

1331,2018-08-14 09:13:39,"While OneDrive works reasonably well on the Mac, the iPhone version is lamentable: it is both unreliable and inefficient and, effectively, not fit for purpose.

I have been using OneDrive on my iPhone to back up my photos, rather than using iCloud.  However, if you manage to get any photos to upload at all you are doing well.  Firstly, Microsoft need to go back to school and learn about the four letters “A” “D” “S” “L”.   The “A” stands for Asynchronous and it means the upload channel on an ADSL Wifi connection is miniscule.  It also means that if you utilise the entire upload bandwidth you block all downloads!  Microsoft evidently don’t know about this because OneDrive on the phone tries to upload 5 or more photos at the same time.  As a result it takes a very very very very long time for even one photo to upload, if it does at all.  Quite often OneDrive just stops.  That’s it.  Nada.  This happens A LOT.  The only way to restart your photo uploads is to delete the OneDrive App, turn off the iphone, turn it back on and re-download the OneDrive app and then start again.  You might have to do this several times if you have, say, 100 photos to upload.  In the process you might want to check if OneDrive is doing anything - if you click on the “Camera Upload” text in the display you will get a list of the photos it is attempting to upload, with a progress bar underneath.  If you notice that the progress bars don’t move, this is not because OneDrive has stopped uploading, but because, well, OneDrive doesn’t update the progress bars, or maybe does sometimes, and not other times.  Who knows…

You can’t select which photos you want to upload - they are handled sequentially five at a time.  So if you have a bit of a backlog (the default state is “not working” so don’t expect OneDrive to upload in the background, or at all) and you need a photo urgently to do some work, bad luck.  After 12 hours I am still waiting for pics to upload that I need to post an ad.  12 hours and four deletes of and reloads of the OneDrive app.

Microsoft are always updating OneDrive, but it never gets any better - in fact it seems to be ever-more unreliable.

1334,2019-12-20 17:57:48,"Update:
So, after 4+ weeks, 24/7, my files STILL HAVE NOT FINISHED SYNCING. I've given up. Unfortunately, Microsoft HAVE lost photographs. I've had numerous email conversations with them and ALL the are able to do is say ""look in your recycle bin"". I've told them 100 times that they are not there. Microsoft support are totally, utterly and absolutely USELESS. Like I've said, I've recently bought a MacBook and am planning to move completely to Apple. Quite surprisingly, I had a small issue with my MacBook and iCloud. Apple were on to it in a flash and within one call back (which happened within 3 mins) issue was supported. I've been exchanging emails with Microsoft for over 3 months on the issue I have with OneDrive and they STILL HAVE NOT RESOLVED IT - despite sending them all the info they requested at least 3 times. Do yourself a big favour and give this App and Microsoft a very wide berth indeed. They'll drive you insane - they have me AND THEY'VE LOST IMPORTANT PHOTOS!!

Update:
Now into day 12 and my OneDrive and In particular Personal Vault are STILL updating/syncing. YES 12 WHOLE DAYS - 12 whole days and counting. How can it take so long to sync files? Apple's iCloud syncd the exact same files in just 5 mins! This really is the worst piece of junk I've ever seen. Hopefully, by Christmas, my OneDrive will have finally updated my files, but I'm not holding my breath. Then, I can spend the Christmas break transferring everything to iCloud and kiss Microsoft goodbye forever. Because, after 37 years as a Microsoft MSDN Developer and an absolute newcomer to the world of Apple, I can honestly say, hand on heart, Apple is a million, million times better. Can't believe I've wasted so much of my life on such inferior software and products. Roll on Christmas!

I've worked in computing for almost 4 decades and have 2 degrees in it and I can honestly say that OneDrive and in particular this App, is the worst software I've ever encountered. There is a major issue uploading and syncing files. But of course, Microsoft refuse to accept that preferring to always blame the customer. On my own Photos taken on my iPhone, which upload to iCloud virtual instantaneously, take 10+ hours over night to upload on OneDrive. And recently, I moved my documents into my Personal Vault and now 4 days - 4 WHOLE DAYS - later it's still uploading and syncing - 4 DAYS!! My almost 40 years have been with Microsoft products. But recently I bought my first ever Apple MacBook and it's an absolute dream. Everything just works. No waiting overnight for just 8 photos to upload; no waiting 4 days, having to unlock Vault every 20 mins, to sync files in Personal Vault. And no being patronised by Microsoft blaming me, when it's crystal clear their issue. I cannot wait till I've moved everything over from Microsoft to Apple and then being able to ditch this truly awful and non-working piece of junk.",1,False,Worst software ever,@Wills,

I have used One drive for a number of years and thought I would give it a try as replacement to iCloud photo stream for backing up my camera roll. However, the experiment has ended unsuccessfully after just a few hours due to a number of design flaws. Here they are:

1.  The camera backup cannot run in the background! Therefore, in trying to upload the initial 2,000 photos from my camera roll, there is a notification every couple of minutes saying: ""Camera Backup is paused. Please open the SkyDrive app"". Upload would take a heck of a long time due to this one!

2. One drive renames all of the photo file names with no option not to. This means that plugging in my phone the 'old' way to transfer photos to my PC, I'll have different file names for the same images. That's a nightmare to version control

3. No ability to pause or cancel an upload once started. Very poor - and something I needed to do when I realised the flaws with the camera roll backup

3382,2019-01-22 17:22:30,"UPDATE: 22Jan19: OneNote is my mainstay research tool both literally and images. The two represent a harmony of data storage, retrieval and definitive art - I should note, artistic representation has never been notable (excuse the pun) but without access to my iPad's bluetooth keyboard, specifically editing MS reviews I'm forced to use the on-screen keyboard, very disappointing! Back to the update: After finally including control of auto-cap which many pursued self included, with vengeance, an option finally appeared - oh what joy. I confess it may have previously existed and my inability to locate may simply have been a personal deficiency, discovering its inclusion delivered a freedom which meant passwords, script and numerous other benefits became unshackled. One final comment, possibly a feature already in the proverbial pipeline (a pun for old MS users) would make Onenote a true master, the unforgettable, the one and only, CONTEXT menu. Using a basic personal locating modal, an all relevant features edit tool, which I believe would adequately serve all Apple®️mobile devices could/should be included, in-particular the option to conduct several changes until all task(s) complete/on-page ""done"" to close. Onenote has come a long way and maybe already features included are available to competitors. I like ""organised"" by giving user freedom to complete numerous edits even - dare I say- find/replace or even handedness features to my mind would really rattle competitive spirits. Such features may lead to ""in-app purchases"" whilst complaints from free-riders would they complain for $1pa extras, no greed just common sense. If you need my version of the context menu algorithm, just ask. Plus still getting the odd crash I say odd, because without error code or historical narrative its difficult to focus and accurately describe. Please reinstate parallel pagination? Happy 2019 to all.

3460,2012-05-05 10:38:59,"Update 2:

Brilliant. 25GB of synced files on all my machines. Ability to choose whether or not to upload full size pictures very much welcomed. 

I have just transferred all of my iCloud disk over and believe SkyDrive to be a very good, if not better, replacement.

Update:

Just realised the automatic compression applied during uploads, very sneaky. Why bother having the functionality of media uploads when you can't even use the full quality originals when uploading? This is even more annoying on the iPhone 4 and 4S where the originals are pretty damn good. This is a big mistake I think, maybe even deal breaker.

Suggest an option when uploading as the native iOS mail app has, where you can choose the level of compression, or choose the full original quality.

Original review:

Very good so far, able to upload and download without hassle and ease of use is a bonus.

Would definitely benefit from being able to select multiple photos and/ or videos when performing uploads. 

Would be great to see this feature in future update, but a great start nonetheless. Can easily see this replacing my soon to be discontinued iDisk.",5,False,How it should be!,adlees,
