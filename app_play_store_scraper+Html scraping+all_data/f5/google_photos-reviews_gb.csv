9/27/2021 18:36,"I have a family member that has been using Samsung ever since 2015 with google photos stored on his phone and he has millions of photos that just now can‚??t be stored anywhere as he‚??s ran out of storage. I completely understand myself, including him that, it‚??s ONLY )1.29 or something a month, but it‚??s just no good that people like him need to be put in a tough situation where you can‚??t store your photos anywhere anymore, even Samsung iCloud is now going to be a ‚??must have‚?? payed sumbscription to store photos on Samsung bc Samsun will delete photos by 30th of September permanently if not stored onto the cloud, which is ridicules for Samsung to even do. And I feel like google photos and other photos and files storing apps should think about, how other people have stored memories somewhere that soon need to be payed for, these are m‚??empestiez we‚??re talking about! It‚??s no good. 
So I finally hope that in the future that google photos will make a real change and increase the default storage to at least 36GB L. Phones nowadays are 1TB and storing photos on 15GB is just crazy. There‚??s a huge difference and this doesn‚??t just apply for google photos, but also default gallery‚??s and photos apps on iPhones and Samsungs that should provide a larger iCloud storage plane.",5,FALSE,Storage,Damo_Kesi_
11/14/2020 15:37,"I‚??ve been using Google Photos for a few years now, mainly as my primary backup of my photographs taken using my phone. It allows me to keep my phone space free while being able to formulate albums, mark favourites and easily share memories to other apps. I am an avid photographer of my children (my memory isn‚??t as good as it was, thanks baby brain) and the Recent Highlights/highlights of this week from previous years has enabled me to easily revisit cherished moments. Now if I had written this review last week, it would have been 5 stars, but the announcement that there will now be a charge has put a dampener on whether I continue to use this app or find another free way of storing my photographs. I‚??m trying to find a way of writing this without sounding petty (and failing) but it‚??s disappointing to see this currently free service now be charged for additional storage, of which shall be within 7 months if the calculated projected timescale for me is correct. The fact that it was free for unlimited storage at a marginally lower quality (which was still amazing quality) was a huge pull for me to use this service. I don‚??t have a lot of spare time to sit and manually back up and organise my photos so this app has really helped me to feel organised and up to date when I‚??ve been able to have a spare few minutes. I am really reluctant to have my photos in different places, but if the charges come through then that may have to be the case.",3,FALSE,Brilliant until the new announcement,Gorebags
7/23/2023 0:06,"29th August 2021 - since the latest update the app doesn't work on my iPad, just freezes constantly. Editing on a phone is a pain. Hope it gets fixed soon. 2nd September - you may have fixed some user issues but you certainly haven't fixed mine. Freezes as soon as I open it on my iPad now, totally unusable. December 2021. Your latest update has saved me a small fortune. I thought the problem was with my iPad and was fully prepared to buy a new one. Now working perfectly again. phew!! 18th December 2022 - since the most recent update the Library button causes everything to freeze and the app has to be closed down and restarted. Latest update claims to have fixed glitches - it has not. Library button still causes everything to freeze. See above. If I change the order of photos in an album, will they stay where I put them or do I have to change the times/dates? Cant find any info online!

Another strange thing happened tonight. At the top of an album, where the title is, I now have a large photo with ‚??Play memory‚?ù at the bottom left.

I highly recommend to get this app, but I‚??d be surprised if you don‚??t have it on your phone.

3/26/2023 22:58,"As per a few reviews on here, I innocently downloaded the app not aware that it would sync all my images up to the limit and then demand I pay for extra storage without giving a way to undo the syncing. I don‚??t want to sign myself up to paying google for a lifetime (when I already pay Apple for iCloud) so I started deleting photos in Google images to clear space, as it was saying I couldn‚??t receive emails, and soon realised this was replicating in iCloud. For a scary moment, I thought I‚??d lost years of memories. I managed to work out how to stop this (turning off backup and sync only stopped it for new images - not the ones that had already synced. I had to delete the app, download it again and deny access to photos when it asked), and but I‚??m still nervous to delete too much from google photos in case the sync is still going to kick into place. So I had to manually pick those I was least worried about to free up enough space to keep me going and keep my email account alive. I‚??m not sure this is actually legal, as nowhere did I actually agree to Google holding all my images to ransom. How can there not be a ‚??restore‚?ù function??

1/15/2020 5:43,"I have been using Google Photos to store and archive my photos and albums since its start in 2015. It is easy to use and very accessible. I take a lot of photos, some just general snaps but still precious and some more professional photos of Birds and Wildlife. Although I always back my photos up on a separate hard drive I use Google Photo to put the photos into albums so that I can share them with anyone I want by just adding a link to an album. It also means I can clear my devices mobile etc of photos knowing they are backed up by google. I can easily add photos at a later date to an album and there is a facility for other people to add their own photos to your album for example if a group of you have been on holiday together and you all pool your photos. 
Google have managed to keep this amazing facility completely free, there is no pestering adverts and it is very easy to use. One can also store bigger format photos and Raw images for a very small fee.

6/2/2023 14:58,"The photo viewing experience is pretty good, it generally loads photos quickly as you scroll through, and I like the album features, including the ability to add text sections to the album. For very large camera photos loading takes a bit too long, so I generally end up re-saving my Fuji photos with higher compression before uploading. The interface also works well with simple swipe up to view photo details etc. My biggest complaint is that you can‚??t prevent videos from uploading on iPhone if you turn on sync. This results in the app taking a long time to backup and if you record large lengthy videos at 4k, it‚??ll soon make it unusable for backups. My second issue is that there‚??s no way to keep what‚??s on Google photos in sync with what‚??s on my PC, so if I delete a photo online, I have to then delete it again on my PC, which is so time consuming when sorting out which shots to keep.

And useful to sync photos to other devices. usualy it took countless hours to sync but this is much faster!

Love the idea of this app and I‚??ve been using it for years across my devices. The latest update isn‚??t great however.

Old 5* review:
This is probably my most used app. I have it installed across all my devices, so I'm able to access and edit photos seamlessly. I have it on the free unlimited storage setting, and it has literally thousands of my photos backed up without any issues. Very simple to use. I originally only downloaded it due to my old iPhone 5S being 16gb, and I required the extra storage, but when I realised that I can share photos directly from Google Photos in to an editing app, I realised it was a keeper, much easier than the built in gallery. I now use it as the default photo app on my 64gb 6S. Honestly, I'd be lost without this app! Highly recommended.",3,FALSE,Everyone needs this app!,Letkateloose
4/20/2020 9:52,"It has the ability to back up all my photos to the cloud and be instantly accessed on any other device, which has saved me countless hours transferring photos to my desktop.
It automatically creates collages and gifs based on photos I have taken, in addition to suggesting albums based on location and dates.
It‚??s completely free with the high quality setting and you get a very generous amount of storage with the original quality setting (you can pay a small monthly fee for more).
It also has an inbuilt editor for photo and video which works very well and also has the ability to search in the app for generic terms to search for certain items using AI (neural network) so I can search for ‚??dog‚?ù and it will show all the pictures of a dog I‚??ve taken.
The only downside I‚??ve found on the IOS version is that it doesn‚??t always backup in real time, this isn‚??t the fault of the app, I suspect it has more to do with Apple‚??s insistence on 4gb of RAM and their over aggressive RAM management policy.",4,FALSE,Probably one of the best photo apps out there,Ebb_And_Flow
5/2/2024 1:41,"I've been using this app for a while now, and while there are many features I appreciate, I've encountered a significant inconvenience that affects my overall experience: the automatic saving of photos. This feature, without an apparent option to disable it, has led to my device's storage quickly filling up. As a result, I found myself compelled to purchase additional storage space, which was both unexpected and unwelcome.

The lack of control over this aspect is quite frustrating. It's crucial for apps, especially ones dealing with content creation or management, to offer users the flexibility to customize settings to their preferences and needs. The ability to enable or disable automatic photo saving is a basic functionality I expected to find, and its absence is a notable drawback.

I hope the development team can address this issue in future updates. Providing users with more autonomy over their settings, particularly concerning storage and data management, would significantly enhance the user experience. Until such improvements are made, my satisfaction with the app remains tempered by this oversight.",1,FALSE,Unable to opt out automatically saving on this app,Tofozzul
3/9/2019 20:26,"The app is the best for backing up photos & with the plus of 15GB, it really is a future proof solution. However, it needs to add the addition of authentication in the app. Photos can be private & we don't want others to have access to it so easily on our mobile devices & computers.  Google accounts are usually signed in on our computers when using the Google search engine, & anyone can access the Google applications without any sort of password to protect them. If Google were to add the support of a passcode on Google photos then it would bring a piece of mind. Also, I dislike that when you want to delete a photo on Google Photos it forces you to delete the photo on your actual device. I do not want to replace my photos app on my device, I simply want it to back up my photos & delete photos I do not want to be backed up.

You can save and download and then upload and then edit - but then you have duplicates. What is the point in having a shared album that isn‚??t shared? If it was called a ‚??limited shared album‚?ù it would make more sense. Why have you set it up this way? If I edit photos on the shared album & I was one the one who uploaded it, the original photo stays exactly the same, not the one that is shared, therefore there is no reason to not have me be able to edit a photo someone else has ‚??SHARED‚?ù because their original photo will not be edited, and if there is a reason some people don‚??t want this then you simply add in an option that photos that are chosen by whoever cannot be edited - you do not however set up a brilliant platform like this and then hamstring in such a stupid way that it renders it useless!

Given that it is effectively a paid subscription (if you have GOOGLE ONE or more) by pretty much the largest internet company in the world it's now pretty dated. Photo editing features within app aren't but should be Snapseed level of detail and OMG the current glitches on iPhone with albums??!!! I've had to creat the same album multiple times as it just vanishes randomly? I've shared albums with my wife - these shared albums are not intuitive to find. Why isn't there a shared tab along the bottom? Kind of like Google drive. The fact that the link with WhatsApp/third party apps doesn't let you share specific chats is a missed opportunity too. Would be great if you could save photos/bids from specific chats rather than all or nothing (avoid random stupid memes from mates ending up amongst proper photos!)

8/8/2019 20:34,"So I use google photos for every single photo I take - I back them up daily from my camera, phone and laptop, and have been doing so for several years. The smartphone app, and the web based page for computers on chrome have been practically perfect. 

The one flaw ruining this particular iPhone app for me, has been the fact that whenever I try scrolling further than a few months down my photo stream (I have 31,000 photos at the moment and fast rising, so I know it‚??s a fair old task for the app, fetching them from the cloud), the page I‚??m scrolling down clicks back up to the top again, and stops me finding those older photos. This leaves me forced to either use the PC version, or wait for an update of the app, as I‚??ve tried every possible solution I can come up with.

I would love to know if I‚??m not the only one having this problem, as I‚??ve not seen it on other devices. 
I have a relatively new iPhone 7, running the same settings and IOS version as everyone I know who‚??s using the app, and I don‚??t see them having problems!

7/19/2020 2:18,"Having comfortably used Picasaweb (and Picasa) for many years and having built up over 100 albums, I find Google Photos to be a big disappointment. The album sort options are non existent. The thumbnail view is not available, instead a collage view which seems to randomly select the size of photos rather than allowing you to make a more meaningful selection. It also seems impossible to prevent GP from backing up all of the pictures on a phone, most of which are rubbish sent by others. Google needs to leave things that are working well (Picasa) alone until they can offer something better.
Further comments- uploading is slow and bandwidth intensive. Unlike Picasa which resized the photos locally before upload, GP uploads full sized files and then resizes for ones albums. This leads to painful and unreliable uploads

There seems to be no way to un-sync my device from google photos, or to just delete photos from google photos and not from my icloud account. 

I currently am unable to send emails or save google docs because of all of my storage being used up, and I‚??m not interested in purchasing more storage. It seems to be a trap they‚??ve purposely set.

Google Photos is really good at doing stuff for you, like sorting out holiday photos into separate albums, finding hidden gems of photos I didn't even know I had and stylising them to make them even better, creating movies and collages from the pictures taken (also created like albums, grouping tore their similar locations, events and times), and helping you delete unnecessary screenshots, duplicates or bad pictures.

3/8/2021 16:56,"After having used google photos for my photo management, primarily as a utility tool, I have been looking to export nearly 5 years of photos to transfer them to local storage home server but google has made it incredibly difficult. 

Originally tried the ‚??Google Takeout‚?ù feature for photos which supposedly is an easy way to export all of your google data, however have had an abundance of problems listed in short here:
1. Takeout bundles .json files with every photo, making importing to another photo manager an absolute nightmare
2. Duplicate files included with takeout (as albums separately formed), causing a lot of manual labour with sorting
3. Lost metadata when exporting meaning organising photos by time cannot be done (easily).
4. Export to other services is broken. Attempted OneDrive and Box but both failed after multiple attempts.

I‚??ve had to go through, month by month and manually download highlighted photos, which ensures metadata is saved.

If you search for something such as a month and year and begin scrolling the photos shown, it will get to a point and you get a loading icon. More photos will load, but then it will jump back to the start. You then scroll down again to be faced with the loading icon again. You get stuck in a loop unable to access your photos.

Previously all my Google Photos would automatically save back to my computer -  Google Photos was always the app I used to sync across all of my devices.

I didn‚??t want to find myself locked out of my account for breaching some spurious rule and lose access to 20 years of memories.

Google Photos no longer has the capability of automatically saving your library back to your computer. It‚??s now a manual process, or (as Google recommend) you use the Takeout feature. Not ideal if you want this level of security.

Google Photos automatically backups photos when you open the app and provides you with the ability to delete the backed up photos from your phone to save space. The interface is clean and easy to use and the app provides suggestions to edit and organise photos.

My only concern is that videos can take a while to upload and, due to the fact that I backup so many videos, my free storage limit is almost full, which I do not plan to increase.

With the Google hub using the albums for showing photos it would be better to be able be really specific on what you want in your album (you can exclude people from memories, so the basic functionality is there already).

Why can't you search for duplicates to help clear up storage.

Users should be able to share photos privately and securely just as you can with Google Drive.
