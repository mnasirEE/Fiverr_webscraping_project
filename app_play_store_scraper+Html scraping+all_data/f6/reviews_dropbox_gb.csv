On my iPad Pro, it is unstable, janky, and highly frustrating to use. A second ago I was searching for a particular file to upload; when I started typing in the file, I received a Dropbox error message.  This happens every time, and means I have to retype the file from 3 to over a dozen times ( I give up after 12 attempts).

Another annoying issue is when trying to upload files in batches. If I wish to upload a group of files, even only a few, I get an invalid file name error. However, if I use the upload function from within Dropbox, the file name is magically no longer an issue. This is so frustrating that I have often considered cancelling my subscription after backing all my files up to alternative storage. I have thousands of files I wish to store, can you imagine how frustrating it is to only be able to upload them one at a time? 

Uninstalling and reinstalling do not fix the issues.

There are several other issues I encounter that make me consider other options; I am waiting to see if things get fixed, else I might have to move.

The app has used 12gb of my mobile data in a couple of days since I switched it back on, despite mostly being connected to WiFi, and video/photo upload off. I barely use the app most of the time so this is inexplicable. What the hell is it doing?! That’s the size of 3 full length DVDs or a large PlayStation game!

It did the same in May and cost me a fortune in extra data charges until I realised the App was using it all. It got through 5gb in a hour that time, although admittedly I had photo uploading on, it seemed to get stuck loading 1 photo constantly. No compensation from Dropbox for all the wasted money on EE data top ups.

I’m a paying user and I’m losing my patience with Dropbox for not sorting this out, if it is not sorted I’ll take my money elsewhere.

It doesn’t allow you to simply open the text editor and add text with autosave as most iOS apps do. You have to tap something before you can edit a text file and then remember to save any changes or edits, otherwise it’s all lost.

The app constantly fails to load the latest version of text files. Instead you get the version last opened on the device, which could be days or weeks out of date. The app may or may not realise this after several minutes and ask you to ‘refresh’ the text file to get the newest version.

This frequently causes conflicted copies of text files.

Dropbox is essential, is has been for years but always been limited with the storage.

1tb is the minimum but I just don’t need that much. Why not offer a lower tier, 500gb or even 200gb.

The design and ideas are brilliant! But! 

Using the “add photo” option (not “upload photo”) : When the mobile app can’t upload a photo, for whatever reason (maybe it doesn’t like the file name or something, but it’s named to the same convention as all the other files in the same place, with the automatic numbering of the photo to minutes and seconds when it was taken), anyway the green progress bar hangs. And then the next files as you add more photos just wait and say “waiting to upload”, but they never do, even if you reboot the app and the phone, and you have to leave the phone on WiFi overnight and power cycle it many times, and even then all you can do to fix it is find the file which is stuck, and delete it and the next one you added - which can be complicated if they’re in different folders. Sadly when you delete a stuck file (which is a photo you took using “take photos” option in Dropbox) you lose it forever. 

So don’t use the direct add options in folders in Dropbox if your files and photos are important to you because you might lose one.

I was using this for a court case where I used Dropbox direct add to ensure the time and date of the progress of the claim was clearly recorded and directly logged but sadly lost evidence due to this bug

And Dropbox support response was the usual moron email saying update your operating system (durr, as if you can do that on an iPhone)

As I said this happened years ago and it took me a whole day to get 2nd line support to admit the bug and then they promised to fix it. Which they haven’t. 

Desktop app on windows is different, if it gets upset about a file it marks it and carries on and let’s you know so you can adjust the file name or whatever is required. 

Really stupid that the mobile app doesn’t offer a way of bypassing a stuck file.",2,Alluicious,Generally ok but Dropbox don’t fix bugs,"{'id': 11328546, 'body': 'Hi there. \n\nWe’re sorry to hear about your experience with our app, and we’d like to know more about all issues you’ve mentioned. \n\nPlease get in touch with our support team at https://www.dropbox.com/support, so one of our agents can gather all the relevant information and details from you, and investigate. \n\nAbout getting in touch with our support team through our app, you can go into our app’s settings, tap on the gear icon, then on Send Feedback, and choose to Request Help or Report a bug. \n\nThanks! \n', 'modified': '2019-10-18T12:02:47Z'}",,,en,us

For a long time it was great, and I have 10 years of personal photos, not to mention all my music studio and work related stuff on there (about 300GB in total).

The problem is that Dropbox MASSIVELY restrict your download speeds when you want to get your information back!!! As soon as you try to download anything over a 100MB, it throttles your speed to around 21kb/s (yes, KILO bits).  This feels like a cynical attempt by them to prevent you from leaving them. Between periods of complete exaasperation, Ive spent the last YEAR trying to download all my  300GB info so i can reupload it to Onedrive, where i dont have the same issues.  And no, you cant simply leave the machine running and do it in one go. The process is glitchy, continually throws up errors that you have to clear for download to resume, and then you mysteriously have files missing that need to be manually found and copied across. 

This is really basic stuff dropbox, how can you have a storage service which restricts users from downloading their OWN information to an honestly offensive speed, that they uploaded to you in good faith?  This is discussed extensively by other disgruntled users on reddit etc, but dropbox are utterly silent on it on their help page and forums, blaming users hardware etc in a help request made by someone that I read on reddit - which is utter rubbish.  I have a HP Elitebook (a £2k laptop) and a 600GB broadband, and have removed all the bandwidth limitations in dropbox, before you ask.

Do yourself a favour and do not get stuck in their ecosystem. Their webplayers for videos and files are abysmally slow also... i believe all the data is stored in datacentres in california, so a clear sign of a company that hasnt moved with the times, and, in my opinion, will go bankrupt one day - taking all of your data with it.

Style and class!

This is the best example of integration between the iPhone and a desktop Mac or PC application. Dropbox is a stunningly well executed solution for data management across machines and platforms. It does exactly what it should and there are some really nice touches. The main Dropbox offerring can be pricey if you take the larger capacity options but then VFM is a relative concept in life. The iPhone app just makes Dropbox even more essential IMHO. The ability to have all my important data on the road with me is just invaluable and in the iPhone for factor it means I don't need to take time out to prepare in advance or lug a laptop around - i just have it all, all the time. I can even email a link to a file for download by other. It's so simple you would think there would be lots of similar solution out there.

Syncing into the cloud and accessing anywhere is a vital part of many people's lives now. Certainly mine.There are many companies offering syncing across the web and across PCs. Dropbox providing the capability on iPhone is brilliant. The only problem is, it has already been beat to the iPhone market by Sugarsync with a superior product, for one simple reason.With Dropbox, you have to create a folder (the box) on your laptop or PC in order to 'drop' the files in that you want to sync. Sugarsync uses your existing file structure and you just right click and select any folder that you want to sync across the web.Sugarsync - set once and dont ever have to think about it again. All relevant files are synced.Dropbox - move or copy your files from your everyday file structure into a different one. A compromise and something you have to think about all the time to make sure you get what you want.Dropbox is a cool app. Try it out, but also try Sugarsync. I have no affiliation with Sugarsync, I am just a happy user and Dropbox introducing this gives me a way to communicate the killer Sugarsync capability by comparison with another major player that doesn't have it.",3,neilfaulkes,"Good, but not as good as Sugarsync",,,,en,us

I was going to write a negative review because the app didn't allow you to export to the iPhone photo libirary but this update fixes that. However I still don't know why when you open a photo folder you get the list view and have to manually change the view to thumbnails. When you exit the folder you get back to list view. The thumbnail view like the native iPhone photo album should be the default view. Do that and dropbox will replace all my photo services like Flickr and Picasa. Would be great if you could forward email attachments to your dropbox. Quick office has a round about way of doing that. Dropoffice needs to implement that as well.

No. I love Dropbox on Mac, but this app is not yet deserving of the praise reviews are generally giving it (maybe everyone is so happy to be thrown a bone at all) - this is due to such a limited feature set. It is as lazy as Apple's own iDisk app - and thats bad. The main thing a is lack of viewing options, and yet this seems to be the apps main purpose, viewing files. I should be able to access setting for the fonts, size of fonts etc... Auto scroll, page up page down. Specific settings for reading txt files, PDFs, and more options besides. Also *please* give us text searching - globally and specifically within each document opened - with the text elegantly highlighted - full search is again, very, very important.

And my question is why would anyone pay £70 for extra space when the service is fundamentally flawed? The flaw is at the heart of this app, namely upload speeds. And since you would buy greater storage space to fill it with stuff, you might want to know how long it takes to upload 2GB of video file. Around eight hours. Yes eight. With live tests showing my upload as 1.27  Mb/s, Dropbox is currently uploading a file at a measly 60 kb/s, consistently so over time. Kick back and watch the grass grow. All my enquiries suggest that Dropbox is the choker, not the ISP. The only good thing to say is that all this goes on in background. Once you've placed a file in your resident Dropbox folder, it will quietly upload anytime you are using the computer and will resume after breaks in use. And in the interests of balance, download speeds are just fine. I chose dropbox to share my own video with friends in the US. The next batch will be put on a thumb drive and airmailed.

I remember having to drive 100 miles to install an upgrade to a customer's site which was probably no greater than 1Mb, so to have our data with us, everywhere, is fantastic. And Dropbox leads the way in the arena, at the moment. The application installs effortlessly, and is extremely intuitive to use, and what it does, it just does brilliantly well.HOWEVER, I though it would be obvious that users would want to deem entire folders as ""favourites"" and set access to multiple files offline with a single touch, rather than having to open individual ones before ""starring"" them for offline access; so, for me, this is a real let-down.Yes, it's still an excellent application, and yes, I thoroughly recommend it, but, as I started off by saying, we're so critical nowadays, and the extra few minutes it takes to set this up to work just how I want it, makes it feel like a bit of a blunder.

It is not possible to resize the folders/files viewer or display it in full screen.

Like many users I have many folders and files with long names - for my work they need to be named in this way.

Everyone else is giving 5GB minimum, with many raising it to 15-25GB (some even 50GB or more!) FREE by now, so users can properly test with decent amounts of data and using larger files, before throwing their money the provider's way, perhaps storing most/all their data there. 

Referrals are a pain, only add 0.5GB for each one, and quite frankly using current users to spam their friends/family/the whole internet is really cheap and naff way to market oneself. One which I refuse to do, as if your service was more affordable, you'd get higher usage naturally without such cheap tactics. 

'Pro' storage used to be VERY expensive too at 1-buck/GB/year (or 1000/TB/year!) regardless of how much you are buying, which was complete ridiculous for 2014. Local storage is exponentially cheaper (~50 bucks/TB) and users get that for several years, until they upgrade storage again. 

Sure, you provide more than pure storage (syncing, API's, etc.), thus are ""adding value"" so deserve to charge a certain extra. But to a user, such price gouging gives an impression of low value to potential customers.

New camera upload feature is good.  Works very well on the Mac and so far it's working very well on iOS.

Can you please add a feature so we can view these annotations or even edit them? Or add our own?

A technology you could look towards creating is the ability to format the text found in PDFs into a iPhone screen-friendly format, similar to how Apple reformats web articles in Reader List.

App Store,9a57fa1b-4bf0-4708-87a7-c0a05532eea9,2012-10-28 07:55:42,"Dropbox is a great backup/file sharing system. I pay extra for increased space and now have all of my files and documents stored on it. I am a mac user and share folders with other users cross platform with no issues.
My iPad has sufficient memory to store all files on it, but is WiFi only, so I am frequently in an environment where I have no internet access, and the ability to access files offline is a key feature. Dropbox will allow me to do this, but only on a file-by-file basis, it is really tedious to select every file in Dropbox as a favourite. 
in addition, iOS stores files for apps in the package for each app, rather than in a central file system like Windows and OSX, so when I open and edit a file on my iPad, the app creates a duplicate copy in its own package and THAT is the file which is edited - hence no update for the file stored in Dropbox. I therefore have to open iCloud on my mac, download the edited file and replace the Dropbox copy once back with my mac. I then have to open Dropbox on my iPad and favourite it again to make it available offline.
Dropbox badly needs to organise itself so that you can specify folders (and subfolders) to store offline as well as individual files, and to somehow improve the integration with iOS so that editing on the iPad does sync back to the Dropbox account.
As my use of the iPad when I am away from my office is fast replacing my macbook, I am getting to the point where I will have to ditch Dropbox and switch to iCloud.
I don't want to have to do this because in my opinion Dropbox is probably the best cloud storage/file sharing system out there!",3,RevJules,More Work Needed,,,,en,us

While doing a cleanup of my iCloud, I saved 8,600 files, photos & videos to Dropbox, Google Photos & OneDrive to make sure I didn’t loose anything, but the difference with the results was astonishing!

Dropbox is the most expensive, I’ve found that it:
• Stores the photo without loosing size
• Uploads & downloads the meta data of where the photo was taken, date, time, and who is in the photo (if you set this up prior)
• It’s the only one that downloaded back to my iPhone usable.MP4 video
• When you delete a file/photo on Dropbox, it doesn’t delete on your device, like the ‘weird setup’ Google Photos has 
• It’s the only one that downloaded back to my iPhone ‘EVERY’ photo, video & file, without corrupted data or errors 

For only a Cloud service, it’s a lot of money for personal use, but it’s the difference between putting your photos under your mattress and hoping they will be there for whatever you want them, or ‘knowing’ that they are definitely safe for whenever you need them.

It’s been broken for a few versions. I mean I’ve got unlimited data for my phone, it would be nice not to have to manually upload things through mobile data and at least have the basic options function as advertised. If I lose my phone that’s entirely the point in having Dropbox back up my camera roll out the window.

The whole purpose of the app: they become the single point of failure you didn’t need and use them to avoid in the first place.

They also still (years now this has been an issue) have not activated recover files/view deleted files for the app. It can finally be done on the website but it’s sort of annoying since they don’t seem to have any reason for this honestly.

Other than this it’s out of synch too often too long, not for the files (thank god) as each folder loads independently but for example if you run out of space then delete files the website will be updated, no worries, but the app will flat out refuse to reactivate for what is effectively ages considering that you’re in a workflow. Small but massive issues.

Other than those 3 (now long standing issues) this app will serve you well until you need to Request Desktop Site and navigate around the app
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I give them 1 star because they know better and can’t seem to be bothered dealing with these issues and never gave or give a good reason as to why these functions are missing or why they haven’t dealt with a simple enough issue. It isn’t very professional and I’ve been premium since 2011. 1 star because it’s beneath them and I took a star off per year we’ve waited for simple things that other apps offered... I consider it very fair of me and a failure of the app development team.

- not being able to edit files (er, it's a file storage and access app, not a mobile office. How do you decide which files should be editable? Should they also include Adobe Photoshop and a PowerPoint editor? No. So pipe down and stop being ridiculous.)

I have been using dropbox on IOS for 12 months now and find it really useful, and this review was going to be 5 stars as a result. 
However as of the last update on 10th April 2015 it no longer reliably shows me the latest version of a file (PDF in this case) from my dropbox account. This ""faulty"" behaviour is occurring on both IOS 7 and IOS 8 and across Ipad, Ipad Mini and Iphone 4s - so its not a device issue.
When I browse my dropbox using the IOS Mobile App, it correctly reports that a PDF File (containing frequently changing info every 15 mins) has just been updated, however when I select it the App usually no longer downloads the file, but instead shows me a version of the file I have previously viewed (and is so already on my IOS Device) a couple of day previously.
Signing Out of Dropbox, deleting and reinstalling Dropbox and restarting the IOS device has no effect on this problem.

Anyway, 2 other things to fix:
- other peoples shared folders appear mixed in with my own. If I had lots of peoples shared folders this would be totally unmanageable. Needs grouping of shared folders by user. 
- sorting: folders are sorted in with files, so if you have large folder structures to organise your files, those folders get mixed in with files and again becomes unmanageable.
