                                photos, sometimes it is a little finicky on that and I have to do it more than once.
                                Sometimes later I’ll have duplicate photos. But even with those few minor issues still
                                definitely worth five stars for the ability to share photos on all my echo devices.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Cons: I uploaded 7,000+ photos &amp; the app is very laggy
                                when I scroll through them. It frequently freezes so I have to close the app &amp;
                                re-open it to continue scrolling which is a pain to find where I left off &amp; continue
                                - knowing it’s just going to freeze again. The further into my photos I get, the more
                                annoying it gets to re-find my place after a freeze. Second con is if you try to edit
                                your photos through the app (basic stuff like cropping), half of the time it won’t save
                                the image and you can’t exit so, again, you have to close down the app &amp; reopen it
                                &amp; try again. If it doesn’t refuse to save it’ll starts to save, but will freeze
                                halfway through “uploading” the saved image &amp; yet again you have to close down the
                                app. All very annoying.</p>
                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">Pro: it saves a lot of space on my phone being able to upload
                                all my photos (but not my videos because I would have had to pay for storage if I did
                                that). I like how when you upload photos it automatically stores them in order to the
                                time stamp on the photo &amp; you can easily search by date. When I upload photos from
                                my camera to my phone it sometimes jumbles all the photos around &amp; when I upload
                                them to the app it re-organizes the photos.</p>

                                like to be able to tag the people myself in photos, also it has automatically done a lot
                                of duplicate photos so I have three and four of each photo in my photos I’m glad that
                                I’m a prime member and it doesn’t charge me, and in the iPad app when I’m putting text
                                on a photo and maybe I’ve done one or two it like will not save it so I have to start
                                all over turn my iPad close the app or out and then try it again and it will take it I
                                called about this and they told me to uninstall the app and reinstall the app I did that
                                but I still have that problem on the iPad and on my desktop I was used to be able to put
                                a photo frame with a color for Christmas red and green Halloween orange and now I cannot
                                do that I’m sorry that they took that away I like that feature of putting a frame around

                                already being a Prime user this was a no brainer. But man the interface isn’t great. It
                                would be 1000 times more useful if you could upload images directly to an existing
                                folder with it then also adding the uploads also to the general photo roll. Instead you
                                have to upload them to the general photo roll, then go in to the album, and select them
                                all over again to add them to the folder. It’s just feels like an extra step that
                                doesn’t seem necessary. It also feels a little clunky the way the “search” “years”
                                “people” etc bar auto appears/disappears when you scroll though the general photo roll.
                                (Disappears when you scroll down to older photos, reappears when you scroll up to newer
                                photos, why?) To me, it would be more useful for that to be sticky and accessible at
                                anytime. Same with that “…” menu that lets you upload photos. That really should be
                                around….always. So all in all, a useful app that could use some UI help.</p>

                                does excellently. If you’re a prime member looking to free up space on your phone, this
                                app is for you. But in addition to storage, I like to organize my photos. The latest

                                always combined multiple family members into one. The plus of the old version was that I
                                could manually override the person tag. Now, I’m stuck with whatever tag the app
                                automatically assigns. This makes it difficult, as I like to make different albums for
                                my individual children. Now my sons are lumped together under the same person tag and I
                                can’t separate them.</p>

                                find any feature that’s not looking at a picture or a memory. The search function is
                                cool as long as I’m not looking for a specific person (see my first complaint). Overall,
                                I like the new streamlined look, but a menu bar wouldn’t hurt.</p>

                                most recent uploaded pictures to be at the top on the album. It used to be this way. It
                                has changed. Now all my recent pictures are at the bottom in the albums I’ve created and
                                its a pain to scroll down 200 pics all the way to the bottom to see if I added it to the
                                album. Please change this feature or at least add a feature for date taken or uploaded
                                within the albums created. I know there is a feature like this under all the pictures
                                taken but not in the albums. Please add this feature. Also, I’ve noticed when I add an
                                article that I have screen shotted with my phone and add it to my albums of saved
                                articles, it uploads in the album backwards. I get the last page of the article 1st in
                                the album instead of last. The first page is at the bottom, not at the top. This feature
                                definitely needs to be changed.</p>

                                each photo which is so many when I do a shoot with 400 images for example. If I could
                                hold and drag to multi-select or create albums in iPhone photos and choose “select all”
                                it would make using this app a million times easier.</p>

                            <p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">I want to like this app, I really do. It has the potential to
                                solve so many problems. Right now though it seems to be stuck with assumption that
                                everyone needs the same solution. Please change the default setting so that doesn’t
                                immediately start uploading ALL PHOTOS! That being said, settings , or lack there of, is
                                a big sticking point for me. I love the idea of the “family vault”, but I want to decide
                                which photos go in the vault. Not just an all or nothing option. I would also like to be
                                able to add folders/albums to the vault and even the ability to restrict access to those
                                if I wanted to. My mother has issues with her eyesight, I would love to be able to
                                simply add photos to the vault or folder/album within, assign her access to them and
                                then have them show up on her Fire TV or her Echo Show device. If I have photos from an
                                event and so does another family member, I want them to be able to add THOSE photos to
                                my vault so that other family can view them. Customization is key.</p>
