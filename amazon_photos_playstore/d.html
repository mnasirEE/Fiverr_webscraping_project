                                <span>****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***<br><br>Hmm...not quite sure
                                    what to say about this "new" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful
                                    prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it
                                    worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've
                                    heard a lot about "other" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not
                                    going to happen to Azon. I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At
                                    least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if
                                    a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I
                                    had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it
                                    pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is
                                    gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. "Resistance is futile". And then along comes
                                    THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has
                                    an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has Azon in front of it. It wasn't
                                    pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND
                                    NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running
                                    WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read
                                    this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and
                                    physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you
                                    not...SHLOOP!<br><br>Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your
                                    pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY
                                    picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to,
                                    can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to
                                    much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.<br><br>So, do I like
                                    it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a
                                    hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!
                                    Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is
                                    leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.<br>***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED
                                    MORE STARS!<br> Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's
                                    "hover parenting" style of running their business. But due to some recent events
                                    that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid
                                    NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam,
                                    smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no
                                    names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines.
                                    Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY
                                    careful, you can still be...umm..."inconvenienced" let's say, by someone trying to
                                    squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me
                                    say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And
                                    (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments
                                    too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS
                                    NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions
                                    anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had
                                    found its way into my phone via "sticky notices". It got so bad that I would not
                                    sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that
                                    were looking for a couch to crash on! I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon
                                    App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought
                                    fiercely! "UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"
                                    When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My
                                    ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps
                                    on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon
                                    is awake...and watching..<br> To all you evil creatures, beware!</span>

                                <span>We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to
                                    learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually
                                    quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb
                                    drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon
                                    because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with
                                    it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my
                                    android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a
                                    charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we
                                    need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!</span>

                                <span>What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many
                                    thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many
                                    photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that
                                    requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and
                                    directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE
                                    benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg
                                    elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but
                                    you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love
                                    that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon
                                    Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to
                                    Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only
                                    copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at
                                    risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know.
                                    I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any
                                    other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to
                                    utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!</span>

                                <span>Since Amazon began offering free unlimited photo storage for prime members, I've
                                    been backing up all my pics from various computers and from archive drives to the
                                    Amazon Cloud.<br><br>WHAT I LIKE ...<br><br>* the price, free for Amazon prime
                                    customers<br><br>* pictures are saved at their full size (unlike the free storage on
                                    Google Drive)<br><br>* relatively easy to use<br><br>* deleted photos remain online
                                    in a deleted folder, so that they can later be restored if necessary. There is also
                                    a "permanently delete" option.<br><br>* ability to view photos in chronological
                                    order. While traveling, I typically will take photos on my iphone, my tablet, a SLR
                                    camera and a pocket camera. Amazon stores just enough metadata to be able to offer
                                    you the option of displaying photos chronologically. So, upon returning from a trip,
                                    I can upload all the various devices separately and still view the pics in
                                    chronological order, without having to first combine the photos from different
                                    devices into a single folder.<br><br>and the most significant benefit for
                                    me:<br><br>* my entire photo library is now available for viewing from all my
                                    portable devices! Additionally, the cache utilization can be set so that recently
                                    displayed photos remain viewable even without wi-fi access.<br><br>.<br>WHAT I
                                    DISLIKE ...<br><br>* time to upload. At the 15 mps speed in my home, I get just over
                                    100 photos an hour uploaded.<br><br>* lack of any way to organize uploaded files.
                                    Photos can't be moved between folders nor can folders be renamed. And unless you
                                    want to have multiple directories labeled "101Canon," you should name your
                                    directories before you start to upload. The same goes for any file names.<br><br>*
                                    while uploading, the software does not display the names of the files being sent or
                                    of those folders in the queue, only the total number of photos queued and the number
                                    already transferred.<br><br>* the need to pull any video files out of the folders
                                    before uploading. Video storage on Amazon is not free (beyond your initial free 10
                                    GB) and, more importantly, those larger video files take FOREVER to upload.<br><br>*
                                    poor photo editing capabilities. If you'd like to do any editing beyond the basic
                                    crop or contrast, I'd suggest you do it elsewhere, before you upload.<br><br>*
                                    limited metadata displayed. You get file name, date taken, date added, file size and
                                    image size. Photos are organized by album and can be sorted, either within an album
                                    or globally, by either date taken or date uploaded. (I am hoping that Amazon has
                                    actually stored all the metadata in the photos I've uploaded and, with enough
                                    suggestions to do so, will begin to display all of it.)<br><br>* occasional
                                    uploading issues. 1) If the uploader discovers that a photo being sent has the same
                                    name as one already in the target directory, it will stop and await user input
                                    before continuing, which sometimes makes it hard to just walk away during the
                                    process. 2) an occasion photo will not upload; in these instances, the uploader
                                    continues and provides an error message with the photo name. 3) on a couple of
                                    occasions, uploading has stopped without explanation beyond a simple error message.
                                    In those cases, I've had to open the directory on the Cloud drive, determine what
                                    picture in what folder was the last to upload and then upload that directory again,
                                    making sure to first remove those photos from the directory that have already been
                                    transferred.<br><br>* occasional duplicates. If you happen to have the same image
                                    stored on multiple devices and you upload the image from each device you'll wind up
                                    with two copies of the same photo on the cloud (assuming each is coming from a
                                    folder with a different name).<br><br>.<br>Given these limitations, here's the
                                    process I've been following with any new photos:<br><br>1) Download the photos to my
                                    PC<br>2) Delete and/or edit photos on the PC, using Picasa or any other
                                    full-featured photo editor<br>3) Save the remaining photos in a folder with a
                                    descriptive name<br>4) Upload that folder to the Amazon Cloud, usually overnight.
                                    For now, I've been keeping the original directory on my PC, as an additional
                                    backup.<br><br>Despite a few shortcomings, I view photo backup on the Amazon Cloud
                                    as a no-brainer, especially for Amazon Prime customers. Unlimited free storage of
                                    full-size photos is a deal that can't be beat. No more worry about keeping multiple
                                    backups at separate locations. I've already lost one set of family photos to a
                                    failed HDD and don't intend to lose another.</span>

                                <span>As long as you're sure you want to pay for prime year after year, it's a wonderful
                                    way to store photos for "free". I mean, it's hardly a deciding factor for purchasing
                                    prime, but it's a really fabulous extra medium for backing up photos. I wouldn't use
                                    it as my primary storage; some form of physical storage medium it's definitely going
                                    to be 1000x better than any cloud storage tool. Still, though, this is a great way
                                    to have access to your pictures/video while keeping your phone lean,
                                    storage-wise.</span>

                                <span>I have had Amazon photos since 2017. No problems until a few days ago when I tried
                                    to access my account in the app kept kicking me out. Couldn't figure what the
                                    problem was until I went into manage account. It stated my account had been locked.
                                    Upon further research online I found thousands of people on Reddit and other social
                                    media platforms that have had the same issue with amazon. Mysterious blocking of
                                    their Amazon photo account and all of them have done the same thing that I haven't
                                    received the same form letter answers that I have. Contact customer service, give
                                    them your information pertinent to the problem, told my customer service you will
                                    hear from tech support in 24 to 48 hours, no email is received and no messages sent
                                    from Amazon, free contact customer support given same response yet again and a case
                                    number. Still no response.<br>This is been going on and on for years with different
                                    people with the same issue. Amazon is fine to let you continue shopping but you
                                    can't access the hundreds of thousands of photographs that they now hold hostage. So
                                    my advice to you keep your money find a subsidiary app that allows you to make
                                    Prince of your photographs in order through them. I recommend Walmart. Amazon simply
                                    doesn't care anymore. Don't believe me do the research yourself.
                                    Below:<br><br>Amazon photo drive locked<br><br>Amazon photo account
                                    locked<br><br>Those two should get you started. But everybody has been receiving the
                                    exact same responses with no outcome.</span>

                                <span>I’ve used several different apps to store my photos and videos in the cloud, with
                                    varying degrees of success. I decided to give “Prime Photos from Amazon” a spin, to
                                    see if it offers any advantages over the other cloud photo storage apps I’ve used in
                                    the past…<br><br>In two words: it doesn’t. It does essentially everything that the
                                    other apps do, only not as well. It was very slow to upload the 1,300 photos I have
                                    on my phone – it took nearly four hours to upload them from my Galaxy S7. “Prime
                                    Photos from Amazon” offers a basic set of tools for organizing photos into “People,”
                                    “Places,” and “Things,” but not much else. I can keep my photos for private viewing,
                                    or I can share them with others.<br><br>“Prime Photos from Amazon” also offers a
                                    useful set of photo editing tools, which can be used for adjusting color,
                                    brightness, and contrast; adding frames and text; and creating memes.<br><br>One
                                    feature of “Prime Photos from Amazon” I find very frustrating. When it first
                                    uploaded my photos, it captured images of different people’s faces from group photos
                                    and set them aside in a section called “People.” Many of these images are of people
                                    I don’t know, and many are too blurry or grainy to use. Yet, the app provides me
                                    with no way to edit or delete those individual “People” images that I don’t want.
                                    All I can do is delete the entire photo from which these “People” images are drawn,
                                    and that is unacceptable to me.<br><br>“Prime Photos from Amazon” was released in
                                    April 2017. Because it is so new, I get the feeling it is still a work in progress.
                                    It has a lot of potential to become a truly outstanding cloud photo storage and
                                    editing app – but it’s not there yet. Right now, it’s strictly average fare.
                                    Recommended (for now) only as a backup for other, better apps of the same
                                    type.</span>

                                <span>I absolutely love how it is UNLIMITED for pictures (can't/hard to find that
                                    anywhere else!) And it's pretty cool that it has the corresponding phone app to
                                    backup your photos automatically too. It is really nice to have peace of mind that
                                    my precious memories will be safe in a cloud if anything happens to the hard
                                    copies...all of this is good for Amazon and as a retention strategy because now I
                                    don't think I can ever pass/cancel my Prime membership lest I lose this very
                                    advantageous service/method...<br><br>5GB for videos is a bit restrictive though...I
                                    mean, I understand how much space it could potentially take, but memories are easily
                                    on videos as they can be/are on photos...and $60 for unlimited videos (as well as
                                    other files) is STEEP...hard to justify...I mean, how about a $10-$15 3-month
                                    subscription versus a single option of a full $60 for the year (no in-between
                                    option)...<br><br>And for pictures (in the Photos &amp; Videos section) to be only
                                    sorted by "date taken" and "date uploaded" is also rather limited as well. Sometimes
                                    dates on camera's are wrong or never set up, or people upload in bulk (like I am);
                                    makes sorting when the files were uploaded all come up in the same section anyways.
                                    Would be nice to have sorted by folder, name, exposure (maybe?), device (camera),
                                    dimensions, location (if geo-tagged), size, tags, even color!, etc...<br><br>Also, I
                                    wish that the program (on PC) didn't only upload only 4 files at a time...If a user
                                    has enough bandwidth, the program should allow for the max possible...Also, it would
                                    be nice to be able to skip certain (big) files and/or only/filter upload by file
                                    type or something...<br><br>TL;DR -- This is an amazing service/option (if you have
                                    Prime membership) to have. Nothing I listed are "deal breakers," but it shows that
                                    there is still a little bit left to be desired; though that will not stop me from
                                    fully using this service.<br><br>UPDATE (8/1/17): So Amazon has done much with Prime
                                    Photos since I wrote my review. I believe Prime Photos was rather in its infancy at
                                    the time of writing. And as I see some people are still reading this review, I
                                    decided it'd be good to put in an update to show what's different/better and/or my
                                    opinion on matters.<br><br>So, since then, it looks like Amazon has inputted more
                                    than just the 2 choice of either free but limited (5GB) or unlimited but expensive
                                    ($60 at the time). Apparently, it's a free 5 GB, $12 for 100 GB, $60 for 1 TB
                                    (still), and $120 for 30 TB. I still really believe doing a very cheap 3 month type
                                    subscription than a yearly one (broken down = $1/month for 100 GB total). I'm
                                    betting people are not so willing to commit to a whole year subscription and not be
                                    able to back out within the year or is forced to wait til the year is over to
                                    cancel.<br>It is nice that you can now sort and filter by objects in the collection
                                    of pictures (i.e. dog, cat, lamp, drinks, cup, party, etc.). Still, I think it would
                                    be nice to add the option of sorting by camera, dimension, size, and even color! If
                                    it were to include those, I think it would be really helpful because in a collection
                                    reaching 5 to 6 figures, those can really narrow down if I was trying to seek
                                    certain ones.<br>But I absolutely LOVE the facial recognition and sorting by face! I
                                    know it's done in other photo archiving/backup services, but it's still really nice
                                    to see it implemented here. It's still doesn't run perfectly (keeps re-arranging,
                                    keeps dropping ID after reconfiguring/rearranging, assigning myriad babies and older
                                    asian ladies bulked together, etc.), but when it does hit, it makes for a nice and
                                    curious feature.<br>It still hasn't really made it capable of uploading more than 4
                                    files, nor the capability to upload only picture or document or other type files (it
                                    would upload a 1.4GB video, reaching the max 5GB, and then skipping all other
                                    documents, .pdf's, and scans). These are sorely missing out.<br>It is nice to have
                                    it automatically "syncing" with the Amazon folder on my computer. I just put my
                                    pictures and picture folders in there, and they automatically upload and backup to
                                    the Amazon Drive and available in Prime Photos. Keeps it simple, easy, and rather
                                    mindless to keep from worrying about another thing...<br><br>Still, in the end, this
                                    is a wonderful, GREAT service to have considering it's no more additional $ to have
                                    with your PRIME membership. And just as before, none of these are "deal-breakers"
                                    again, just that there are still things left to be desired. But I can't think of any
                                    reason why this isn't anything but beneficial to PRIME members!</span>

                                <span>First to the people that say they were charged or that it doesnt work on your
                                    kindle fire or any other issues how about you try to fix it your self first. The app
                                    is after all for FREE Amazon didnt have to create a cloud app, but they did. You
                                    really think they would create an app thag doesnt work on their own product?! If
                                    uninstalling and reinstalling doesnt work them do some work on search engines or
                                    Amazons help files for options or alternatives.<br><br>They would not make a new
                                    product that wouldn't work on the Kindle Fire's that would be logically stupid on so
                                    many tech and business levels. If I can run this app on a old Samsung Galaxy Epic
                                    1st gen phone then you can most certainly run it on you up to date kindle or tablet.
                                    My table (if your curious) isnt a Kindle but my friends is. My tablet is Samsung
                                    Galaxy Tab 2.0.<br><br>This app is obviously VERY new and with any type of software,
                                    or new pc, new tablet, new anything in the electronic world there are going to be
                                    little issues and updates will ALWAYS follow. Just be patient.<br><br>This app is
                                    set up right now for PHOTOS ONLY I am sure this will change. For those that have any
                                    brain cells working YES this is all connected to the cloud drive period. If you go
                                    to Amazons website or help section it clear describes two services, one for
                                    music/mp3 that is free up to a limit or you can then purchase a annual subscription
                                    for tons of more space to store your entire music collection. Then there is The
                                    Cloud. This is for ALL files from photos, documents, etc. The app sadly only handles
                                    photos and syncing which is great, but if your paying for a service then you want it
                                    to naturally have more and include the ability to conduct the files too. This is all
                                    new so I hope to see updates in the future. (Side note, someone said there is
                                    another amazon cloud app for everything else, there isnt as far as I can tell, I
                                    checked.)<br><br>For those that say other competetors are cheaper, review your math
                                    skills. I did a price comparison chart to compare which is the better buy,
                                    especially to huge rivals like the big G, and guess what??? The price is about the
                                    same! When you break it down per dollar per Gigabyte the amounts the SAME. The major
                                    difference is payment, Amazon only does annually, the big G does ONLY monthly, they
                                    have no billing method set up yet for anual payments. They said they would add this
                                    in later/soon.<br><br>OVERALL..if you are already using Amazon services to buy
                                    things, to get books (its original source of popularity), or music (they have better
                                    rates and specials on music than that piece of fruit named product), then this
                                    should be added to your collection. It will make things easier and prevent you from
                                    loosing your photos on that precious device if it should ever experience a firey or
                                    watery pit o'doom.</span>
