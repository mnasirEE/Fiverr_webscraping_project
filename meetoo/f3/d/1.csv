Trinity the Cat,12/6/2022 3:21,"I‚Äôm able to make albums and even edit photos right in the app to fit the wide format of the echo screen. I can use the albums as slide shows on my echo devices so that each one is personalized. I can share photos remotely on my mom‚Äôs echo, this is priceless. She is 94 and really appreciates seeing the photos I upload for her. 

The app is not intuitive but I have been able to manage using it, and until I finally figured out how to get back to the main group of photos I would just exit out of the app and restart, but I have since then figured out how to do it. 

I don‚Äôt allow access to my entire photo library on my phone because I only want to upload certain photos and not need to search through hundreds of photos, sometimes it is a little finicky on that and I have to do it more than once. Sometimes later I‚Äôll have duplicate photos.

Robbinsk,1/3/2023 15:32,"Cons: I uploaded 7,000+ photos & the app is very laggy when I scroll through them. It frequently freezes so I have to close the app & re-open it to continue scrolling which is a pain to find where I left off & continue - knowing it‚Äôs just going to freeze again. The further into my photos I get, the more annoying it gets to re-find my place after a freeze. Second con is if you try to edit your photos through the app (basic stuff like cropping), half of the time it won‚Äôt save the image and you can‚Äôt exit so, again, you have to close down the app & reopen it & try again. If it doesn‚Äôt refuse to save it‚Äôll starts to save, but will freeze halfway through ‚Äúuploading‚Äù the saved image & yet again you have to close down the app. All very annoying.  
Pro: it saves a lot of space on my phone being able to upload all my photos (but not my videos because I would have had to pay for storage if I did that). I like how when you upload photos it automatically stores them in order to the time stamp on the photo & you can easily search by date.

Grootgirl100üëã,4/23/2023 2:53,"I‚Äôve had this app my whole life, and my whole family uses it. It saves all your photos/videos. When I think I lost them I can just look here. Also I love how in this app there is people, by that I mean it shows a list of people and you can see all the photos there in. That‚Äôs very helpful for me, also I find how you can do the location (find a photo that way) is very helpful. One more thing I like is that you CAN delete the photos added, like maybe you don‚Äôt like them, but they save to this app, you can just delete them. Now the thing I do dislike, when you press on the person, just photos show up no videos, which I find a bit annoying. Another than this, I love this app, and I üíØ recommend it.

Black1304,9/27/2020 8:01,"When it works correctly, this app is great. After I sign it, it usually works for 3 or 4 days, then will be stuck ""checking"" for x-amount of pictures, never loads them and then I either have to sign out and sign back in or delete the app and download it again. Then when I login, it's stuck on the login page for about 12 hours, then is on a blank white page for about 12 hours, then everything is fine and it works for a few days before I have to repeat the process again. I have some photos that it has never backed up and it apparently never will because even when I tell it to upload them, it gets stuck and they still never backup. But... for free... and unlimited storage... I can't be too mad.
Update: the app has been working amazingly well, until iOS 14. Now every time I open the app it gives me the login screen, but I have to log out first or nothing happens.

Missing_LeftPhalange,11/21/2022 13:22,"I really needed somewhere to store my photos and videos, and already being a Prime user this was a no brainer. But man the interface isn‚Äôt great.

Instead you have to upload them to the general photo roll, then go in to the album, and select them all over again to add them to the folder.

- First, the facial recognition has never been great. It‚Äôs always combined multiple family members into one. The plus of the old version was that I could manually override the person tag. Now, I‚Äôm stuck with whatever tag the app automatically assigns. This makes it difficult, as I like to make different albums for my individual children. Now my sons are lumped together under the same person tag and I can‚Äôt separate them. 

- Second, the user interface is unfriendly. It‚Äôs difficult to find any feature that‚Äôs not looking at a picture or a memory.

CiaraSebecke,12/28/2019 19:16,"As a photographer I love that this allows me to store high quality RAW files from the camera without having to pay for expensive cloud storage outside of my Prime membership!!

I edit most of my photos on iPad so its great as I can just import them from camera and back them up here and my hard drive. 

There is ONE THING that is super annoying and should be fixed- the ability to multi select or select all. I dont want to back up every single item in my photos just the RAW photos and edited versions. So I have to manually select each photo which is so many when I do a shoot with 400 images for example.

Yuls24,5/25/2018 7:32,"* Review updated

I started using the app after several days which were necessary to upload all the photos from my phone. There are definitely nice features. I like that the app offers you to look at the pics that were taken on the same day previous years.
My biggest disappointment, however, is that the app backs up pictures as soon as they are taken (if wi-fi is available) and doesn‚Äôt update them if they are being edited. I take quite a few pics a day and, at the end of it, I edit the best of them. If they were baked up some time earlier in the day, they remain unchanged. 
I was hoping that Prime Photo could be a free (well, I pay for prime either way) substitute of iCloud, but, unfortunately, it can‚Äôt. As soon as I get a new phone, am I supposed to edit a couple thousand pics again?!

***
I haven‚Äôt really started using the app yet, but I‚Äôm already frustrated. I have lots of pictures on my phone - around 8 thousand. I know it takes time to copy/back them up, but not that much! The app was running a few hours at night and several hours in the morning, it managed to back up only a half! My phone barely works when it‚Äôs running and they want you to keep the app open for it to work faster which means I can‚Äôt use my phone at all. I stopped myself from deleting the app several times already. I hope in a few days it‚Äôs gonna download all the pics so I could finally check out all the features.",3,FALSE,Still have to use iCloud,

You should easily be able to straighten a page without manually doing it. Auto capture is great but not all pages will be exactly flat please allow for skewed or off angles folds etc and correct easily.

A base virtual page down that matches the base color of the document would also be good.

FaerieOwl,5/23/2023 19:27,"This app does a wonderful job of packing up all my photos off of my phone or my iPad. It usually does it automatically, but sometimes I have to open the app for it to back up all the photos. This is not a hardship, just one tap on the app and it opens. I wish in the People part of the app it would allow me to choose the pictures that it sorts into people‚Äôs names, because it always puts my sister‚Äôs pictures in my name and will not let me change that. For me that‚Äôs the only problem with this app. Otherwise I‚Äôm really thrilled with it.

Update:
For almost a year now the backup function is spotty at best. Some photos and movies get backed up, but some do not. If I take 2 photos of the same thing, one gets backed up and the other doesn‚Äôt.

SushiCamiChar,2/7/2018 14:16,"One thing would make this a 5 star review: Would love it if the picture was removed from the main photos page when you add it to an album.

1st as I was trying to upload photo for my Echo Show, the app decided it had to notify me through mid selection that it needed to update.. I lost my progress of selecting 30 photos.. okay no biggie I can reselect it. 

After it did what it did, I tried to reselect the same photo.. well where is the upload section? It‚Äôs hidden in settings.. why is this the location for such an important function? I had to google where it was FYI.

At this point I am desperate to add photos to my echo show because I have a party to host.. so here I am selecting photos with over 11k photos without a way to narrow it down...

The interface is a bit clunky and is a major memory hog. 

The other issue I have encountered is that it is no longer recognizing my canon raw files after processing them through Lightroom (CR2 files). The problem just started in the last month so I am not sure the issue. However this would be a major negative if it can‚Äôt store canon raw files. 

It‚Äôs by no means perfect. The information and instruction on use is lacking which in my case lead to a major error. In one case, I eliminated a folder on prime, only to discover that that action also deleted the original file on the hard drive. Luckily I had the raw files still on the memory card. 

In summary, if you are a prime member, you should absolutely use it. It‚Äôs another way to back up your pics at no cost.

Elwood_37,11/4/2017 20:33,"This is almost a great program. However, it falls short in a number of crucial ways.

Firstly, there is no way to correct the many mistakes the facial recognition software makes. When it fails to recognize that an image contains a person, I can‚Äôt manually tag it. What‚Äôs worse, it frequently misidentifies two or three people as being the same person, and there‚Äôs no way to manually disambiguate.

Frustratingly, the facial recognition 'People' folders index only the photos uploaded by your own account. They leave out all the photos of the same people in the family vault. So it‚Äôs not a very useful compilation of all the photos of somebody.

Thirdly, while this app allows manual album creation, your albums are stored only on your own account, and are not visible to anyone you add to your family vault. It‚Äôd be a huge bonus to be able to share albums with your family members.

David in LA,2/27/2018 23:43,"This is an excellent way to back up your iPhone photos, which will otherwise quickly eat up your 5GB cap on free iCloud storage.

I suggest setting automatic backup of pictures BUT NOT videos, as videos count against your 5 GB cap on free storage. Not so your still pictures, or even Live Photo‚Äôs! Save individual videos to Prime Photos to manage that 5GB cap.

Back up is not automatic; you have to have the Prime Photo app active on your phone, and ‚ÄúAuto-Save‚Äù enabled in settings, for the backup to take place. Again, in settings, I suggest you keep the ‚ÄúVideos‚Äù switch (for auto-save) set to off.

Photos can easily be moved to an album and filtered by date; the date of a photo (say, that you download from something someone else posted) can be edited to match the date of the event.

Alternatively or in addition I would like to have a setting option that allows my phone to automatically upload my photos in the middle of the night, when by bandwidth is less taxed and in demand.

Player KEK,6/12/2020 21:31,The app is almost automatic and easy to use for almost all its functions. You do have to open it occasionally since it does not seem to upload photos until you do so.

SETpro,6/12/2019 18:57,"Overall, I like this app. Easy to update, locate, and share photos. Reasons for 4 stars instead of 5: 1) limited video storage, 2) no option to opt to continue to load photos offline if on WiFi and it‚Äôs annoying to need to stay in the app to complete backup, and 3) facial recognition software thinks two babies are one person and there‚Äôs no way to fix that.",4,FALSE,Pretty good,
