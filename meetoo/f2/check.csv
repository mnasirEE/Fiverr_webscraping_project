Not worth the money",10/09/2022,"I have had Amazon photos since 2017. No problems until a few days ago when I tried to access my account in the app kept kicking me out. Couldn't figure what the problem was until I went into manage account. It stated my account had been locked. Upon further research online I found thousands of people on Reddit and other social media platforms that have had the same issue with amazon. Mysterious blocking of their Amazon photo account and all of them have done the same thing that I haven't received the same form letter answers that I have. Contact customer service, give them your information pertinent to the problem, told my customer service you will hear from tech support in 24 to 48 hours, no email is received and no messages sent from Amazon, free contact customer support given same response yet again and a case number. Still no response.This is been going on and on for years with different people with the same issue. Amazon is fine to let you continue shopping but you can't access the hundreds of thousands of photographs that they now hold hostage. So my advice to you keep your money find a subsidiary app that allows you to make Prince of your photographs in order through them. I recommend Walmart. Amazon simply doesn't care anymore. Don't believe me do the research yourself. Below:Amazon photo drive lockedAmazon photo account lockedThose two should get you started. But everybody has been receiving the exact same responses with no outcome.

""Prime Photos from Amazon"" has a lot of potential to become truly outstanding – but it’s not there yet.",13/09/2017,"I’ve used several different apps to store my photos and videos in the cloud, with varying degrees of success. I decided to give “Prime Photos from Amazon” a spin, to see if it offers any advantages over the other cloud photo storage apps I’ve used in the past…In two words: it doesn’t. It does essentially everything that the other apps do, only not as well.  It was very slow to upload the 1,300 photos I have on my phone – it took nearly four hours to upload them from my Galaxy S7. “Prime Photos from Amazon” offers a basic set of tools for organizing photos into “People,” “Places,” and “Things,” but not much else. I can keep my photos for private viewing, or I can share them with others.“Prime Photos from Amazon” also offers a useful set of photo editing tools, which can be used for adjusting color, brightness, and contrast; adding frames and text; and creating memes.One feature of “Prime Photos from Amazon” I find very frustrating. When it first uploaded my photos, it captured images of different people’s faces from group photos and set them aside in a section called “People.” Many of these images are of people I don’t know, and many are too blurry or grainy to use. Yet, the app provides me with no way to edit or delete those individual “People” images that I don’t want. All I can do is delete the entire photo from which these “People” images are drawn, and that is unacceptable to me.“Prime Photos from Amazon” was released in April 2017. Because it is so new, I get the feeling it is still a work in progress. It has a lot of potential to become a truly outstanding cloud photo storage and editing app – but it’s not there yet. Right now, it’s strictly average fare. Recommended (for now) only as a backup for other, better apps of the same type.

You get what you pay for: Basic Image Repository With No Bells Or Whistles.",02/04/2015,"Uploaded a few Gb of pictures as a test.Site is fairly quick on a decent internet connection, both up and downloading, and browsing.If you take RAW camera pictures with Cameras that are older than a few years, they will not be accepted as images but as Data Files! This means you need to sign up for the unlimited data subscription. However, BIG Tiff and PSD/RAW (Adobe Photoshop files, 50-300Mb ea) are recognized as image files.Other than that, uploading was no problem, but pay attention to the option for destination directory!If you don't, you have to manually move the files to a directory that you create either before or after the transfer.Place your files in Directories based on your details you usually search by!Sorting on site is SUPER BASIC, either by: File Name, Date Added/Date Modified or Size.Date Added is useless unless you equate Date Added with Date Created (you'd have to upload images straight from your Camera as you take them.  Otherwise the File Name has to have the Date in it, but still would not sort by Date Created if you have several cameras you use that same day since each camera would have a distinct name.Today each camera created picture (unless scanned) has EXIF data that contains the Date Created/Taken, Camera Name and much more that could be used for more detailed searches like typical computers are capable of.Knowing these limitations before you start uploading files helps in setting up a system that allows you to find your pictures again.In time I hope this storage ends up looking more like a simple photo search, sort and retrieval archive rather than the shoe-boxes full of pictures of yesteryear.

It's ok but it has a LONG way to go",01/03/2022,"Facial recognition is not great and the app / service is just lacking in so many ways but since Google started charging, I switched because this service is free with Prime membership. The really good thing is unlimited storage for full size photo files in included as long as you're a prime member, but the included video storage allowance is pretty pitiful. I suppose that's so you'll pay for additional storage, but the service just isn't up to par with others so I'm reserving that possibility for later. They really need to give us the ability to add notes and information for each photo that is searchable especially because the facial recognition is so bad. I really hope they step up their game here, it could be so much better!!

Sort by Date Taken does not put videos in the right order.",12/06/2023,"Having a date edit for photos is a nice feature.  This feature does not matter for videos as the Firestick photo app does not read the date stamp properly.

.... still needs some work.",02/04/2015,"not ready for prime time yet. I love Amazon and I love Amazon Prime so I was excited to try this out.  it was very easy to upload photos from my computer to the cloud and I have a fast connection so it went quite quickly but when I put them in the uploader I put them in individual folders and a series of as many as 10 sub folders. for example there were photos from three different vacations so I created 3 folders each one named with the name of each vacation. with each vacation there were as many as 10 separate subchapters. however when I look at them on my fire TV it shows up with 30 different folders and that's it. the hierarchy is gone so I can't go to the first one and then click down who this subchapter. my sense is Amazon will figure this out quite quickly and do an update but at the time currently that part is a little bit weak. also after I uploaded them and I looked at them on the online viewer I was able to sort them by the name of the date taken and I could cycle through them in the proper order once again but I tried it on my fire TV they seem to be playing in reverse order. I think a few tweaks with our software will fix this and it will be a great service.

frustrating and not super user friendly.",30/05/2016,"I enjoy that I can back up my photos with this app but it's annoying trying to figure out how to unpause the backup after I paused it to preserve my battery. It's not easy to find without going and searching how to do it. I've never had to go search for instructions for an app before. I used to work for a cell phone company and have been using android phones since the G1 came out with T-Mobile. I don't feel this one is extremely user friendly based on that. The battery drains heavily during photo backup, more so even than the google photos app during backup and I was backing up even more photos than I did this time since I have already deleted a lot off of my phone. I expect some battery drainage, more so than normal usage of the phone but this was a bit excessive in my opinion.

Single Sign-on Is a Disaster",13/06/2014,"After updating this app, I got a message on the screen saying that signing in to Cloud Drive would sign me in to ALL my Amazon apps. I didn't like that idea at all, so I tapped Sign Out. Now I can't sign in to the Amazon AppStore on my device: ""Login Issue: Please use a valid email and password."" Obviously, since I'm posting this review, I know how to sign in to my Amazon account correctly. So now I can't access Amazon apps on my device that require AppStore sign-in. But when I try to sign in to Cloud Drive, I get ""We're sorry but we were unable to sign you in. Please try again later."" I've tried signing out of my account through the online browser, clearing the caches for the AppStore, Cloud Drive and browser apps, then restarting my device, but that didn't help. Will now try deleting Cloud Drive completely. If that works, it's staying deleted because it's not worth the hassle.Update: Deleting Cloud Drive didn't fix the problem with AppStore; I had to uninstall and reinstall it. Haven't had time to check my other Amazon apps but at least now I know what the fix is (I hope). Cloud Drive stays gone; I can't have this kind of productivity disruption domino effect all over the place because of one non-essential app. I hope none of the other Amazon apps follow this course because I'd hate to give up AppStore, Amazon Local, etc. But I'll pick the one app I deem most necessary and eliminate the rest if I have to. I don't need all the doors and windows thrown wide open just because I open one. There are enough stability and security issues for consumers as it is.

Useful but not a Mature Product.....If you are not IT savvy you might want to look into something a little more click and go",26/11/2015,"Well it seems to do as advertised at the moment .upload is terrible though..have to use a 3rd party app to sync to it automatically.....the three stars are for back end so far..I like the web GUI and well the Picture date finder needs some love ....it marked some photos as taken in 2025.....this has all the beginnings of a new app...obvious gaps in functionality...it needs to mature to be a serious cloud offering. You cant just throw up an unlimited storage sign and call it good cus it says Amazon in it..To be honest I think it is dumbed down for the 99% who will have less than a  GB to backup and make it profitable....I realize I am capped by my ISP upload speed but there should be better ways of managing it and there seems to be a file size limit...not good...

Lost without directions. . .",08/05/2015,"I had hoped by using this software I would finally be able to access by Android phone's photos and download them to my computer from the Cloud. Unfortunately, I have been trying for several days to upload my photos from my phone to the Cloud with very little success. The lack of Help info is distressing and I have been stumbling around trying to GUESS how this upload is supposed to work.It uploaded my first 'album' with little difficulty but pretty much ignored the other two albums. A check of the 'settings' showed the upload had been paused due to no wifi. I find this rather erroneous as my wifi network is function quite efficiently.Also, each time I select the photos I want to upload the software unchecks my selections as soon as I touch save. Is this the way it is supposed to work? I have no clue as there are no directions that I have been able to find. If anyone in the 'know' out there has a clue, please fill me in.I have left my phone plugged in to the charger 24/7 and the second album has finally showed up as uploaded to the Cloud. I am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping the third album will finally show up--but I am not holding my breath!
