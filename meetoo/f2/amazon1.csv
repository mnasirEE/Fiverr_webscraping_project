Your Pictures Are NOT Private! And there is no customer service!",18/05/2024,"Amazon has been charging me $ 5.99+ tax a month for a LONG time now and my account is locked due to what they are calling ""inappropriate"" pictures or videos on my account. As a result, my account is LOCKED and I can't see what the hell they are talking about, as a musician who records videos for YouTube and IG and X (formerly Twitter) this is infuriating as a lot of my videos are backed up on this Photo app!Whenever I click on the Photo app it says my account is locked and to contact customer service but there is no way to contact customer service but they continue to charge me every month!Fair warning this also means that someone at Amazon is going through everyones pictures and videos on this app meaning that there is no privacy!At this point, Amazon owes me probably close to 100 dollars in monthly subscriptions that have been paid with no access to my photos and videos!"

Horrible!",16/04/2024,Why can't you batch a group of photos to delete rather than one by one.  Horrrible!!!  Definitely NOT user friendly.

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Amazon photos",26/03/2024,You had to go and change Amazon photos and now it's a mess. It was so user friendly now it's crap. I spend alot of money making photos through Amazon but now I will go elsewhere...

Decent but could use editing tools like Google Photos",14/03/2024,Easy to use interface. I like the look and feel. Would be even better if they can include photo editing tools such as background blurring like Google Photos have with their storage plans vs storage only.

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

Photos and videos are deleted",02/02/2024,"My photos and videos that where in the trash where deleted. I deleted photos by mistake and went to retrieve them from the trash bin and they are gone, permanently deleted. I cannot get any customer service help and I've called and written messages on the help site. Amazon policies is they will store your deleted photos for 90 days, I'm sorry to say they didn't adhere to this policies. Years of photos are gone. Do not trust your photos with Amazon drive."

Albums not included",18/01/2024,"Your photos will come to prime photos as one lump, not separated into albums as you probably have them in ""My Gallery"". The separations like ""Grandchildren"", or Yellowstone"" , or ""My pets"", are not carried over.  I now have a ""lump"" of photos THEY separated by date, or facial recognition, or something I didn't choose.  While it's nice to retain your photos for free, it's not at all workable. Google's, ""My Gallery"" is much better."

If I use the desktop app, they never go anywhere because it just runs for an hour, crashes, and never uploads a single photo.  Completely worthless and frustrating application."

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away.

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

I deleted photos by mistake and went to retrieve them from the trash bin and they are gone, permanently deleted. I cannot get any customer service help and I've called and written messages on the help site. Amazon policies is they will store your deleted photos for 90 days, I'm sorry to say they didn't adhere to this policies. Years of photos are gone. Do not trust your photos with Amazon drive."

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

Photos and videos are deleted",02/02/2024,"My photos and videos that where in the trash where deleted. I deleted photos by mistake and went to retrieve them from the trash bin and they are gone, permanently deleted. I cannot get any customer service help and I've called and written messages on the help site. Amazon policies is they will store your deleted photos for 90 days, I'm sorry to say they didn't adhere to this policies. Years of photos are gone. Do not trust your photos with Amazon drive."

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away.

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away.

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."

New print service is garbage",01/04/2024,"Have been using prime photo for YEARS. Love it. Love that it syncs automatically with my phone and I don’t have to think about it. I’ve never had an issue with the storage EVER. Truly a great service and I recommend it to everyone I know. **BUT** it would appear they recently decided to farm out their print services to a different vendor and it’s TERRIBLE. I have ordered pictures from dozens of different sites … they all work a little differently and that’s ok but it always takes a minute to figure out the editing, navigation etc. This one? Nope I simply gave up.  Terrible interface. Not at all intuitive. When I get the urge to toss my phone across the room that’s when I walk away. So unfortunately Amazon will no longer get my print orders …. I’ll leave my storage here but my prints will go through sfly sadly!"

Paid storage is not shared",05/03/2024,"I want to love Amazon photos as a family because we can back up all our photos and videos and quickly setup prints of our favorites. The biggest issue I have is that the application has paid storage as you can imagine. If you setup an Amazon household with a family member, you would think your paid storage would apply to all members of the household. Unfortunately, you cannot. This seems like a huge oversight. We want to use this as our designated family platform and this is a huge hurdle. Having every family video sent to me so that I can be the one to upload and use the space is ridiculous."

Issue with Amazon Photo Calendar",03/03/2024,"I created a family photo calendar in 2022 without absolutely no issues.  The calendar came out beautifully,  and was shipped quickly.  In 2023, I created another family calendar and received the first 3 in a timely manner. I tried getting 5 additional calendars printed; however, as of March 3rd, they still have not printed.  I made numerous calls and sent several emails to Amazon without any help. I am very disappointed because it took a while to create the calendar, and was hoping to send them to other family members."
