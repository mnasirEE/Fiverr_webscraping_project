Aside from that this is great, best photo app. U can add whole albums to hidden unlike the default app. Ads are no issue if u know how. 
It is a bit of a chore re-organising all files. It doesnt carry albums and folders over from main app. So u have to remake them all. But it is good",4,False,Best found so far,hdhehreisbwi,"{'id': 40272240, 'body': 'Hello!
