Verified LinkedIn User","""Fine option for storage and sharing ""
                
Pros: I use iCloud mostly for
                    data back-up and sharing. I appreciate the easy syncs between my laptop and iPhone. 
Cons: At times, the sharing seems
                    clunky. Airdrop frequently doesn’t work, and sometimes shared folders take a long time to pop up.",3,10-Jul,21-Mar-24

                            A.","""Affordable and reliable ""
Overall: I have been using
                    iCloud for years now and I’m more than happy with the service. The plan is affordable and seamlessly
                    integrates across multiple devices. Apple focus on security and them continually adding new security
                    features is something that is much appreciated when storing important data on the cloud. Although, I
                    always recommend backups on a USB just in case.
Pros: Plans very affordable
                    particularly the 50 GB that is almost free.
                    Reliable
                    Fast synchronization
Cons: Would love bridges with
                    other file storage systems like Mega. Wish there was some sort of settings to allow direct transfers
                    from one cloud storage service to another

ANDREW V.,"""Unhappy User""
Overall: Up to now very easy
                    and pleasant, but with all the ""security"" measures, really, really unpleasant. I plan to drop iCloud
                    completely.
Pros: Nothing. I used to like it
                    and it was my e-mail for years. Now it is not a pleasure any more
Cons: Too many security measures.

Monica M.,"""I love everything Apple!""
Overall: It would be nice if
                    Apple offered more free products with their Apps, but if spending money is necessary, it is
                    affordable compared to other products I have used not Apple affiliated. 
Pros: Apple has the best security
                    software and features hands down! 
Cons: In order to use most
                    products offered by Apple we must pay for it.

Stefania M.,"""Great cloud""
Pros: iCloud is perfect if you
                    have Apple devices and you need to access your files from different devices. It synchronises across
                    all your devices and you can easily find your documents, edit them or delete them.
Cons: If you have a Windows

Cons: I thinks it’s a little

"Habibah M.


Verified LinkedIn User","""iCloud review from my perspective""
Overall: I enjoy several
                    features of the iCloud service, including the simplicity with which backups can be performed, as
                    well as the speed with which they can be performed directly on the iPhone. I dislike the five GB of
                    space they provide the user with; it should be more. I use iCloud to save the most valuable videos
                    and photos possible for backup purposes and backup WhatsApp.
Pros: The most valuable feature
                    of I Cloud is how you can store your data for business or personal use in a secure location without
                    having to worry about it. In recent years, as data and required documents and images increased, it
                    became difficult to maintain storage, and you were forced to bring several devices. With I Cloud,
                    you no longer needed to. 
Cons: A reliable and effective
                    method of storing documents and files for Apple product users, where your files and data are
                    protected, is a proper backup solution. It's has an excellent user interface; I've been using it
                    effectively for two years without encountering a single problem. The only thing that needs to be
                    revised is the pricing structure, as it varies by country and by length.

Verified LinkedIn User","""Great Online Storage - especially when you are in
                    the Apple ecosystem""
Overall: Using various Apple
                    devices (iPhone, iPad and a Macbook) it mostly just works in the background and you hardly ever
                    notice its there at all. Like with all cloud storage services gone are the days of loosing a bunch
                    of files because of a hard drive failure, gone are the days of 'oh that's on my computer at home, I
                    cannot access it right now'.
Pros: Within the Apple Ecosystem
                    iCloud works behind the scenes, mostly unnoticed. Purchasing it with an AppleONE subscription is a
                    great deal.
Cons: If you work with non-Apple
                    devices it works, but is nowhere close to as seamless as it is within Apple's walled garden. There
                    is still a lot of software that does not sufficiently support iCloud (or vice versa) and file
                    sharing is not its strength (it is possible, but not comparable in ease of use to dropbox)
Alternatives Considered:
                    OneDrive and Box
Reasons for Choosing
                        iCloud: I chose iCloud because of its tight integration with Apple
                    hardware, but also because the price for 2TB is competitive. When AppleOne came to market, it became
                    an even better deal.
Switched From: Dropbox Business
Reasons for Switching to
                        iCloud: I originally made the switch to iCloud mainly because I wanted
                    to ensure that my photos are properly backed up, but since have moved all my cloud filing storage
                    needs to this service as it just works.",3,10-Oct,8-Dec-21

Verified LinkedIn User","""Great software wish more came with the free
                    version ""
Overall: My overall experience
                    with iCloud has been relatively on the positive sign except for the one incident which I’m still
                    dealing with of I was charged for the 2 TB of storage but I don’t have access to it and I’m still
                    dealing with that but other than that, it’s been a great software and hands down probably the one on
                    use for the rest of my life
Pros: I love most about this
                    product is the fact that you get 5 GB with any iPhone iPad iPod or MacBook for free and then if you
                    run out of that you only have to pay $.99 and you get 2 TB which is amazing it is a steal.
Cons: I don’t like the fact that
                    only 5 GB come with the Apple product that you buy I think it should be more but like I said in the
                    one above Brian nine cents you get 2 TB which is not that bad, but there are some people out here
                    that can’t afford $.99 said to me I wish there was just a little bit of maybe like 10 GB that we got
                    for free instead of just five.
Switched From: Google Drive
Reasons for Switching to
                        iCloud: I initially switched when I got my first iPhone but I have no
                    use both of them at the same time because I’ve run out of my 5 GB of storage on my iPhone and I was
                    charged for 2 TB but they say I didn’t get charge for it I’m still dealing with that so in the
                    meantime, I’m out of my storage space on my iCloud. I have transitioned to using both iCloud and
                    Google Drive.",3,10-Aug,12-Jan-23
Jordan M.,"""A Great Cloud Alternative for those in the Apple
                    Ecosystem""
Overall: Overall, it has been
                    great. I do also use to to back up my mobile devices automatically, so i know I've always got copies
                    of everything I need. Very simple to use, and already integrated into devices.
Pros: Since iCloud is made by
                    apple, it is naturally built into all Apple devices. As someone who is already deeply in the Apple
                    ecosystem, not having to set up a 3rd party piece of software makes storage quick and simple. I can
                    navigate my iCloud through my finder windows on my Mac to easy, fine, restore, download, or upload
                    files.It also makes sharing with other Apple users very easy. A simple collaboration link sent to a
                    client allows specific folders to instantly be viewable and editable in their finder windows as
                    well, which can streamline workflow and file transfer without needing to go to a web
                    browser.Additionally, having iCloud back up my desktop and laptop ensures I always have access to
                    everything I need when I am travelling.
Cons: Unfortunately I still
                    require the use of other Cloud Storage systems, as many clients still view iCloud as more of a
                    ""Person"" cloud storage device for things like photos and documents from their iPhones. Many clients
                    are still using things like Google Drive and DropBox simply because they've always used that for
                    ""business"".I think a shift in presentation may be required if iCloud wants to take over more as a
                    business solution.
Alternatives Considered:
                    Dropbox Business, Google Drive and Box
Reasons for Choosing
                        iCloud: I do still use DropBox and Google Drive with some Clients.
                    However, with my Apple based clients I'm am shifting more toward iCloud for ease of use and sync.",3,10-Oct,10-Sep-23

Verified LinkedIn User","""One of the best cloud storage service""
                
Overall: iCloud is very useful
                    in backing up and storing my files on the cloud space. It help me to clear my phone storage and i
                    only store important file and document on my phone that i usually need it for offline access. 
Pros: Using iCloud to saving all
                    my contact information, photo, video, audio and document to the cloud storage is very smooth and
                    effective with this application. It has no file size limitation on how small or big the files that i
                    am uploading to the storage. Changing from my old phone to my new phone is no problem as i can
                    access to my files back as long i am using the same apple id with it.
Cons: Managing the files and
                    emails on this application is quite headache. The searching feature is too slow in showing the
                    result and often, it returned a result that are not matching with the keyword that i have entered.
                    The synchronized process also quite slow and takes some time for it to be shown on the my other
                    device.

                            J.","""Convenient storage service for Apple
                    users""
Overall: I use iCloud to store
                    all my photos from my iPhone and documents on my Mac. It makes it really easy to access photos I
                    took on my phone from my Mac and vise versa with documents created on my Mac accessed on my phone.
                    It also provides peace of mind knowing that should anything happen to my phone or Mac my photos and
                    documents will be safe on the cloud. If you use Apple products you should try iCloud, especially if
                    you use more than one Apple product and like accessing files between phone and computer. 
Pros: I've used other cloud
                    storage services before but iCloud is my favorite for a few reasons. I use only Apple products so
                    iCloud is extremely convenient. The integration is seamless on iPhone and Mac. You can set it up
                    easily and quickly and access the cloud on any of your Apple products. There is a free option that
                    offers a good amount of cloud storage and the paid option is very reasonable for the amount of
                    storage you get. 
Cons: I've encountered a few
                    problems with iCloud like my photos not automatically being added to the cloud and not being able to
                    access documents from my Mac that were stored on the cloud from my phone. Most of the time iCloud
                    runs smoothly but every now and then I experience one of these glitches. Luckily customer service is
                    excellent and they always solve the problem fast.

Verified LinkedIn User","""Incredibly easy to use, integrates with the Apple
                    ecosystem perfectly""
Pros: The ease of use and instant
                    syncing is the best part of iCloud. It just works, as Apple liked to say in the old days. I love
                    being able to pick up any device and have everything I need. I use the 2TB plan, which is an
                    incredible value, and is more storage than I personally will ever need I suspect. If you use Apple
                    devices, there's really no reason not to have an iCloud account, and usually to pay for at least the
                    200GB tier, unless you really use very little data.
Cons: The only real drawback
                    would be if you use Android or Windows devices, you get less access to features, though some still
                    work. And the Photos syncing to a Mac is sometimes slow.

Pros: I recently need to

                    computer first like the old way. It really saving my time in setting up my new phone. 
Cons: I don't like the structure
                    or process when deleting the files on the cloud storage. It will need to be selected manually one by
                    one and no option to deleting it all by bulked. The free storage is quite small compared to other

Overall: My experience with
                    iCloud overall is great while using it to backup all of my photos and videos between my iPhone and
                    MacBook. However, for files and documents, I much prefer to use Google Drive, as it gives much more
                    flexibility.
Pros: I like that iCloud just
                    works seamlessly with Apple products, especially for storing and syncing photos and videos to the
                    cloud automatically with the Photos app. It is also an excellent option for backing up devices such
                    as an iPhone or an iPad. It is easy to use and only takes a minute to set up.
Cons: There is only 5GB of free
                    storage which is significantly less than Google Drive. Also, there is a huge gap between the
                    different paid storage options of 50 GB, 200 GB, or 2 TB with no option in between.

                    iCloud Drive is also not as good for file management as Google Drive. It only lets you sync a copy
                    of your documents to iCloud, rather than being able to move your files completely to the cloud for
                    online storage to save space on your device.

Mohammad R.,"""Pros and Cons of Apple's Cloud Storage
                    Solution""
Overall: Overall, my
                    experience with iCloud has been positive. As an Apple user, it offers a convenient cloud storage
                    solution that integrates seamlessly with my devices. While the limited storage and lack of
                    cross-platform compatibility can be a downside, it's still a great option for Apple users looking
                    for an easy and convenient way to store and access their data. However, I must say that I'm happy
                    using Pycharm as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, as it offers me a range of
                    features and customization options that meet my programming needs.
Pros: Seamless integration with
                    Apple devices: As an Apple user, I find iCloud extremely convenient. It seamlessly integrates with
                    all my Apple devices, making it easy to access my files and data from anywhere.Automatic backup: One
                    of the best features of iCloud is that it automatically backs up my photos, videos, and other
                    important data. This gives me peace of mind, knowing that my data is safe in case my device gets
                    lost or damaged.Easy file sharing: With iCloud, I can easily share files with my friends and family.
                    Whether it's a document, photo, or video, I can quickly share it with others using
                    iCloud.Collaboration: iCloud also offers collaboration features, making it easy to work on projects
                    with others in real-time. This is particularly useful for work-related projects or school
                    assignments.
Cons: Limited storage: iCloud
                    offers a limited amount of storage, and if you need more, you'll have to pay for it. This can be a
                    downside for users who have a lot of data to store.Not cross-platform: While iCloud works seamlessly
                    with Apple devices, it's not as convenient for users who have non-Apple devices. For example, if you
                    have a Windows PC or an Android phone, you won't be able to access your iCloud data as easily.

                    Data Management""
Overall: I got to use iCloud
                    for data management and collaboration during my internship at the university's Department of
                    Pharmaceutical Development and Research. I was able to view and sync crucial files and research
                    material with ease across all of my Apple devices because to the flawless connectivity. Critical
                    research documents might be safely stored and backed up in the cloud, guaranteeing their
                    accessibility and security. Real-time cooperation with my team members was made possible by iCloud's
                    collaboration tools, which also made it easier to track our progress and communicate effectively.
                    Overall, iCloud proven to be a dependable and approachable tool for organizing, synchronizing, and
                    working together on data for pharmaceutical research.
Pros: A number of useful features
                    that iCloud provides make it a well-liked option for data management and synchronization. Its
                    seamless connection with Apple products is one of its primary benefits, enabling users to view and
                    sync their files, images, contacts, and more across various devices with ease. Users may safely save
                    their data in the cloud using iCloud, giving them piece of mind and guaranteeing data backup. Users
                    can share files and work together in real time using the platform's collaborative tools. Along with
                    iCloud Drive, iCloud Keychain, and Find My, iCloud easily connects with other Apple services to
                    create a full ecosystem for managing and securing your digital life.
Cons: Despite the many advantages
                    of iCloud, there are a few things to take into account. First off, iCloud's free storage tier has a
                    maximum capacity, so users who want more space may have to upgrade to a paid plan. Although they are
                    rare, some users have occasionally encountered syncing problems or delays. Another major drawback of
                    iCloud is that it was developed exclusively for Apple products, which limits its interoperability
                    with non-Apple platforms. Additionally, for customers who are new to the Apple ecosystem, there may
                    be a learning curve for the advanced iCloud services like iCloud Drive and collaboration tools.
                    Despite these minor flaws, Apple users continue to find iCloud to be a dependable and practical
                    cloud-based option.",3,10-Mar,16-Jun-23

Verified LinkedIn User","""For many-device or heavy backup/cloud sync needs,
                    stay far away or use additional backup solution""
Pros: When I first used with just
                    an iPhone and an iMac, everything worked pretty well and there is really no configuration. Current
                    plans and family sharing make it a pretty affordable cloud/sync option for everyday users.
Cons: iCloud isn't a true
                    backup-type solution (even iCloud Drive) and once I became a power user and added another Macbook,
                    Apple TV, and Apple Watch, it became a living nightmare once it broke. After 6 months I am still
                    trying to piece together all my files and photos to ultimately get off iCloud as best I can.

                    Apple makes it nearly impossible not to use iCloud somewhat. You will experience non-stop synching
                    issues once you get a large iCloud drive or photos library, and since it is designed to ""just work""
                    there are no controls or settings to stop it. You can't really turn it off, either, since it will
                    hang and then scatter remnants of your file folders in the iCloud Archive. Once corrupted or you
                    start having sync issues, all your devices will malfunction constantly and there is not much you can
                    do...everything from my Apple Watch music loading to the battery life tanking happened. I'm
                    referring to 15+ GB photo libraries and 80+ GB of files in an iCloud drive....if you have 3+ Apple
                    devices and large amounts of files that are important, immediately find a secondary backup and try
                    to move photos and important files there.

                    I've used OneDrive's app for photo syncing on my iPhone and then to my Mac, and used Google's
                    wonderful Drive FileStream (available with GSuite business accounts) to keep things in place while
                    I've restored, reset, etc. more than 200 times in the past several months. I have 5-10 copies of all
                    my folders scattered over computers and iCloud Archive files I am still trying to sort out.",3,10-Mar,6-Jul-18

Overall: Using iCloud for
                    basic back up storage is about the only thing I would recommend iCloud for. Otherwise I feel that
                    the features are very limited and hard to use. I still have no idea how to access my full iCloud
                    data much less how to get my employees to be able to find an access it. I also find that when trying
                    to find and view data in my iCloud that it has been deleted without my knowledge. I do not trust
                    iCloud and I do not feel my data is safe or that it is an investment that is time efficient for my
                    company. I do not recommend iCloud, use a different software. 
Pros: I like how easy it is to
                    set it up and start backing up my data. I also like how easy it is to change my plan as needed.
                
Cons: I really don’t like how I
                    feel I have no access to my iCloud data. I know it’s there, but I have no idea how to find and
                    access it easily and quickly, much less have my employees access it. I also feel that my data is not
                    as safe as on other platforms. I feel that things are subject to being deleted without my knowledge.
                    The pricing is also very expensive for the limited features I receive compared to other products.

                    more productive as I always have access to update them. When I have free time they are always with

Pros: The fact that my
                    files/photos are always with me is so important! They are instantly synched across all my Apple
                    devices so a file I was working on in the office is still with me when I get home... or to the
                    coffee shop where I can continue my work on whatever device I have with me. It allows me to choose

                    additional storage space is pretty inexpensive. The convenience of having my work with me without
                    having to download files to a thumb drive/portable hard drive, etc. before leaving is such a time
                    saver! It allows me to always be prepared to discuss a current project!

                    over any platform i know its expensive while we upgrading to storage but i think it's worth coz the
                    security and and access that it's provide i think no any company can beat so if you're like me who
                    cares about privacy and safety i definetly suggest to shift iCloud
Pros: Yeah i am very very
                    impressed while i am switching from android but man the icloud is just wow i can easily login
                    everywhere and access and also manage my data too much easily and i am govt servent so i need full
                    of security coz many files are sensitive so it helps me more and my all apps data including third
                    party apps was very greatly stored so i can easily switch to any iPhone with only just login my
                    icloud with all data
Cons: Coz is just like it giving
                    5gb free storage so i think its not enough like me if it was 10gb so i think its better, some
                    android apps integration is not possible in iPhone coz its privacy and security issues ,

ANTONIO G.,"""UN CAPOLAVORO DI APPLE!""
Overall: Uso iCloud ogni
                    giorno. La ritengo una invenzione incredibile per chi usa tutti i dispositivi apple. iCloud
                    garantisce la sincronizzazione perfetta di tutti i dati, da note al calendario, dalle foto ai file
                    pdf o word con pages, allo Storage di tutto. Se si perde o viene smarrito un dispositivo basterà
                    collegarsi da quello nuovo con il proprio account iCloud e tutto apparirà nel nuovo dispositivo.
                    Comodissima la possibilità di salvare in iCloud il buckup del proprio iPhone. Infine, ma non per
                    importanza, la sicurezza. L'identificazione a doppio binario garantisce sicurezza e affidabilità.
                
Pros: I vantaggi di iCloud sono
                    tanti e li riassumo: Piani economici, gestione comodissima e intuitiva da iPhone e iPad e Mac (anche
                    dal sito iCloud), sicurezza a doppio binario, possibilità di salvare in iCloud anche il backup del
                    dispositivo e di tutto il suo contenuto. Uso iCloud da circa 8 anni, quando un virus ha totalmente
                    cancellato tutti i miei file di lavoro e le foto. Dal allora ho stipulato un piano d a2,99 euro al
                    mese e tutto ciò che carico o creo nei dispositivi apple viene automaticamente salvato su iCloud.
                    Niente può perdersi o dematerializzarsi. Tutto a portata di mano.
Cons: Non ritengo ci siano
                    inconvenienti da segnalare. Certamente per avere un iCloud diciamo efficiente bisogna aderire ad un
                    piano a pagamento in quanto quello di ""serie"" non offre uno Storage adeguato.

                    since 2014, and i literally have documents since that day still stored on there without any loss,
                    it's secure so i won't have to worry about my data getting lost or hacked or leaked, our company
                    uses it on daily basis without any worry, it's collaborative, it has real time sharing and
                    synchronization, and it's cheap if you pick the right subscription that suits your needs.
Pros: The security is by far the
                    best, the ability to access your storage in real time is an added benefit, the ability to go through
                    years of data without a hassle and without any worries that your data would be lost, the
                    synchronization between devices, and personally, you never have to worry about any photos taken that
                    you might not have enough storage, subscribe to an iCloud bundle and take pictures worry free.
Cons: i haven't faced any issues

                    exclusively worked with Apple products, having a iMac, iPad and iPhone, iCloud was the definitve
                    solution for document backup. I could work seamsless between all the devices depending on where I
                    was working and this made me feel like the Cloud was a unifying experience. All your files follow
                    you wherever you go no matter what device you use.

                    It is probably the best Cloud experience you can get, and has been since its very inception. 
Pros: iCloud is de facto the best
                    solution for Apple product owners. Its integration with iOS is pretty much flawless and users can
                    enjoy peace of mind when it comes to personal file backups. It's even accessible from a browser
                    making it compatible (in a way) with other operating systems. On Mac computers, its integration is
                    also seamless and renders the process of backup look like saving on the computer itself.
Cons: It has its limitations
                    though. Where other user-end backup services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon storage and more can
                    store any file type, iCloud is pretty much limited to Apple-only documents. It works perfect for
                    Apple-centric users but is less ideal if you have for example a iPhone and a Windows computer.

                    Software is excellent, however, it needs some improvements, iCloud could be improved in terms of
                    additional features, such as real-time collaborative editing, document version management and
                    tighter integration with third-party services.As a User, I may find iCloud a little difficult to use
                    with regards to aspects such as initial setup, managing permissions and document sharing,
                    synchronizing and backing up data, as well as compatibility issues with different platforms or
                    devices.Sometimes integrating with my existing business processes as iCloud is primarily a cloud
                    storage solution for myself and other consumers. However, Apple offers mobile device management
                    (MDM) solutions that can help integrate iCloud with existing business processes in companies and
                    organizations.

Reasons for Choosing

                    on my individual needs and preferences.I chose iCloud as it is a cloud storage service to sync my
                    files between my Apple devices, iCloud was the obvious choice as it is a native Apple service with
                    seamless integration with their products and operating systems.In summary, the choice between iCloud
                    and Oracle (or any other product) depends on the user's individual needs and preferences.",4,10-Oct,2-Apr-23

Cons: Documents are able to share
                    only with people who have an Apple ID. Unfortunately, access to data is limited from MS Windows

                    hand, mostly fully sufficient. Controlling the entire iCloud is too simple and slow in the MS
                    Windows version. Such a design is too simple and does not meet the requirements of the 21st century.

Overall: The overall
                    experience has been great. Our files and folders are automatically synced (from the document folder,
                    download folder, and desktop). We can also easily share Numbers and Page files.
Pros: iCloud is an excellent
                    backup solution. It can back up your device and sync data between devices, so you always have access
                    to the latest versions of your files on all of your devices. The iCloud service is very easy to use.
                    You can set it up in just a few minutes; after that, you're ready to go. You can also start using
                    iCloud immediately if you sign up for an Apple ID—the account that allows you access to your
                    purchases on the iTunes Store, Apple's App Store, and other services offered by the company.You can
                    also share files with friends and family members through the service. A few clicks will get your

                    robust data recovery option that at least is as functional as DropBox.
Pros: I like that it is easy for

                    internet connection.
Cons: I absolutely do not like

                    the customization of the Apple Finder this is pretty jarring and pretty inexcusable. This is not

                    not my own work station. I also don't like the basic lack of ability to recover files that have been

Overall: When using iCloud to
                    store my files and sync my data, I have been overall satisfied. The automatic sync and backup
                    features are particularly useful. However, the cost for additional storage space and the need for a
                    stable internet connection can be drawbacks. Overall, I recommend iCloud for its ease of use and
                    data security.
Pros: I am really pleased with
                    using iCloud to store my files and sync my data between my iPhone and PC. The interface is intuitive
                    and easy to use, making it a great choice for users of all skill levels.The automatic sync feature
                    is particularly useful for me, as it allows me to access my latest files and documents from any
                    device, whether it be my phone or my computer. Cloud storage is also very convenient, as it allows
                    me to free up space on my device while still having easy access to my files.I have also enjoyed the
                    ability to share files with other iCloud users, such as my photos and calendars. This allows my
                    family and friends to easily access this information and use it to organize events and vacations
                    together.Lastly, the automatic backup of my iPhone is also a very valuable feature for me as it
                    gives me peace of mind knowing that my data is safe and can be restored if needed.All in all, iCloud
                    is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable and versatile cloud storage service that
                    allows you to store, sync and share files and data. I highly recommend this service.
Cons: While using iCloud to store
                    my files and sync my data between my iPhone and PC, there are a few aspects that I don't
                    particularly appreciate:1. Cost of additional storage space: While iCloud offers some free storage
                    space, it may be necessary to purchase additional space if you need to store large amounts of files.
                    This cost can become expensive for some users.2. Internet connectivity requirement : In order to use
                    iCloud, stable internet connectivity is required, which can be an issue for users in rural or remote
                    areas or for users on the move.3. No file sharing with non-iCloud users: The ability to share files
                    with iCloud users is convenient, but it is impossible to share files with people who do not have an
                    iCloud account, which can be a nuisance for some users.4. Limited feature to manage files on
                    computer: The features to organize and manage files on a computer are quite limited compared to
                    other cloud storage services.In conclusion, iCloud is a reliable and useful cloud storage service,
                    but it has some disadvantages related to the cost of additional storage space, the need for stable
                    internet connectivity and some limitations to share files with non-iCloud users, as well as the
                    limited features to manage files on a computer. It's important to weigh these factors before
                    choosing iCloud as a cloud storage service.",3,10-Aug,10-Jan-23

Overall: Un ottimo sostituto
                    della memoria fisica del dispositivo, con il vantaggio della condivisione cross-device e la
                    sicurezza che i miei dati vengono conservati anche in caso di smarrimento o danno irreparabile del
                    dispositivo hardware.
Pros: iCloud permette di disporre
                    di uno spazio di archiviazione cloud associato al proprio utente Apple e condiviso da tutti i
                    dispositivi in uso (iPhone, Mac, iPad…). Questo permette un’esperienza particolarmente fluida,
                    potendo leggere ed editare i propri documenti, foto e video inclusi, da tutti i propri dispositivi
                    come se tutti condividessero lo stesso identico hard drive. Questo ha semplificato enormemente il
                    mio lavoro in mobilità. Inoltre consente un importante risparmio sull’acquisto dei dispositivi
                    stessi, potendo puntare su tagli minimi di memoria, andando poi a sfruttare lo spazio sul cloud per
                    i file utente.
Cons: Credo che molti utenti non
                    ne abbiamo compreso le potenzialità perché restii a sottoscrivere un abbonamento, in quanto il piano
                    standard incluso con il dispositivo è di solo 5 GB. A mio avviso il piano standard dovrebbe essere
                    di almeno 128 GB (con tagli che rispecchino i tagli di memoria). Trovo inoltre macchinoso il sistema
                    di condivisione dei file con altri utenti, soprattutto se utenti non-Apple.

Cons: iCloud naturally wants to

                    Due to the excellent search features, this is not a problem and I am coming to appreciate the logic

                    files in almost every available app.
                    I also like the ""smart storage"" the system has, where heavy files are not downloaded to the device
                    to avoid disc space usage. 
Pros: I'm mostly an Apple user ,
                    so I decided to move all my data storage to iCloud due to the integration with the platform and
                    devices
Cons: Sometimes the sync fails
                    and the only solution is to logout and login back to restart the process, but it also affects otter

Pros: What I liked most about
                    this software is that it has a low cost for a big space storage, and I can upload my files and

Overall: My overall experience
                    with iCloud has been great, as I have been able to store numerous amounts and types of files using
                    the service, and have then been able to easily and efficiently get a hold of them whenever necessary
                    by using the search/filter option. I also find that sharing files with others directly through the
                    cloud is an efficient process, which is also very convenient when compared to the alternative, which
                    would require the downloading of files and then separate emailing/texting of them. Overall, great
                    service and would definitely recommend.
Pros: What I like best about
                    iCloud is its fantastic ability to store a wide range of files in the cloud, regardless of their
                    format, whether it be a simple text document or a video made by using a complicated external
                    software. I also very much like that the service is free to use if an immense amount of cloud
                    storage is not needed, and that the service is accessible to people who do not even use the iOS
                    software on their primary mobile device and/or tablet. Lastly, I like that iCloud can be accessed
                    using virtually any device that is connected to the internet, whether it be a smartphone, tablet,
                    desktop, or laptop. Overall, it is a great service for anyone looking for decent cloud storage
                    capabilities.
Cons: The one aspect of iCloud
                    that I think can be further worked upon is its ability to sync more information from iOS devices,
                    rather than just the default apps created by Apple such as notes, calendar, photos, etc. In other
                    words, it would be convenient if all, or at least most, of the third party apps on a user's iPhone
                    or iPad can also be synced to the desktop/laptop version of iCloud whenever someone is attempting to
                    access the cloud that way. Other than that one small aspect of the service, I cannot point out
                    anything else that can be considered a con, which is a great thing when considered overall.",3,10-Aug,6-Aug-21

                    transition there have been major changes. However, the iCloud feature-set has been relatively stable
                    for nearly a decade now, with features being added or tweaked, but not removed. At this point,
                    iCloud can very much be described as a mature product - and an essential product for Apple users.
                
Pros: iCloud is built-in to all
                    Apple devices, and as such is seamless to setup and use. In addition, iCloud is more than just cloud
                    storage, as it provides a robust suite of apps and tools including: Keynote, Numbers and Pages;
                    Email, Calendar, and Reminders; iCloud Keychain (a password keeper); Find My device support
                    (allowing you to find your lost or misplaced Apple devices); mobile device backups, and iCloud Drive
                    which is akin to Dropbox or Google Drive.

                    Additionally, iCloud storage is reasonably priced starting at only $1/month for 50GB of storage up
                    to $10/month for 2TB of storage.

                    My favorite feature is iCloud Photos, which allows you to sync all of your photos across all of your
                    devices, with desktop and mobile app counterparts allowing for robust organization and editing.
                
Cons: There are two big downsides
                    to iCloud: 1.) While many of the features will work on a PC, iCloud is designed specifically for
                    Apple devices and users. 2.) While iCloud can be used in a business environment, it is very much
                    designed for personal use as there is no central management console to manage multiple users. The
                    closest you can get is an iCloud for Family plan - which is limited to 6 users.

                    In addition, while there is a free tier of iCloud, it is limited to a total of 5GB of storage across
                    all devices and all features.",3,10-Jul,28-Jul-21

Verified LinkedIn User","""iCloud - The Default Storage Choice for Apple Users""
                
Pros: iCloud is Apple’s answer to
                    Google Drive and other online storage options. I have used it for slightly over 2 years and there
                    are some areas where it works and other areas where it doesn’t work. Here are my thoughts on it:

                    1. iCloud works better if you in the Apple ecosystem. If you live and breathe Apple, iCloud can seem
                    magical and wonderful all in one. It works for syncing documents, contacts and backups and it is all
                    done securely. If you have multiple devices, simply logging into your Apple ID gives you access to
                    all your iCloud content.

                    2. iCloud drive allows you to easily share documents between devices and with Apple features like
                    continuity allows you to pick up work and other things on another device. This is probably the best
                    feature of iCloud in my opinion.

                    3. The Files App and Finder allow you to view and share, delete and edit cloud based documents. If
                    you have specific apps linked to iCloud drive, you will find it easy to see the changes in near real
                    time.

                    4. I consider the entry level 5GB to be a con but on the flip side, the pricing for other storage
                    tiers feels fairly reasonable in my opinion. I just wish Apple started out at 10GB not the measly
                    5GB.

                    5. The Find My iPhone/Mac feature is just genius. I lost a phone a few months ago and was able to
                    login and block if from being used within minutes after it was taken. 
Cons: As mentioned before, I do
                    not think 5GB cloud storage makes any sense in 2019. I found that within a few weeks, I was already
                    using 90%+ of my storage.

                    If you have a Windows laptop, I wish you good luck making iCloud work well there. You may download
                    an app that installs it on your computer but it seems it is only good for iCloud Photos but it is
                    not as intuitive and functional as if you were on a Mac or iOS device.

                    I am also not sure if iCloud can be business friendly, it seems more tailored to individuals and
                    families. If you ask me, Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive do more on the business front compared
                    to Apple. So for personal use, yes sure, but for business, you are better off looking elsewhere.",3,10-Sep,18-Jul-19

Overall: Apple iCloud is
                    perfect solution for everyone who don't want to spend hours on integration with some cloud service.
                    It provides simple and intuitive UI with basic features and sharing options.
Pros: Apple iCloud document cloud
                    storage is the easiest implementation for users who use other Apple products. It performs super
                    intuitive and easy to learn interface which allows users to store their documents with the same way
                    as in the regular computer folder on disk. Sharing is also implemented. You are allowed to share any
                    document with other user in or outside ecosystem through the mail or iMessage link. I don't know any
                    possibilities about implementation the system with other products outside Apple ecosystem. Apple
                    iCloud is also available in web interface after typing Apple account details.
Cons: The performance is a bit
                    slow. Sometimes uploading a bigger files took a while. I also miss some extended features like
                    additional encryption or better search / filtration. Windows application is very bad, I don't like

Pros: I've used various cloud
                    storage services before, but for a few reasons, iCloud is my favorite. Considering I solely use
                    Apple products, iCloud is really useful. On both the iPhone and the Mac, the integration is
                    seamless. It's simple to set up and use, and you can access the cloud from any of the other Apple
                    devices. iCloud is software with the free option with plenty of cloud storage, and the subscription

Cons: I've had a few issues with
                    iCloud, such as my images not being immediately uploaded to the iCloud and then not being able to

                    security as there are many news of people that has their iCloud account been hacked and their data
                    is compromised. Adding more security feature to the software is much needed to ease our mind of the

Pros: iCloud is, without a doubt

                    especially when it comes to family plans. It allows me to sync my info across all of my Apple
                    devices effortlessly. Apple customer service is fantastic; they go out of their way to assist you in

                    all of my data. It's effortless to switch to a new smartphone and restore your info. 
Cons: iCloud's email somehow
                    doesn't distinguish between different sorts of emails, such as advertising, social media, or
                    promotions, but instead groups them all into the same single inbox. At first, figuring out how to

Pros: I like the fact that it
                    integrates very well with all Apple devices, rather seamlessly. It is definitely easy to use and
                    deploy. There is a feature with iCloud+ which not many people know wherein they can hide their email

Cons: Definitely, it is not
                    cheap. It comes at quite a steep price and you would require a lot of iCloud storage to use or store
                    all your files. I have also realised it is sometimes a bit slow to sync.

Verified LinkedIn User","""ICloud bello ma...""
Overall: La mia esperienza con
                    icloud nel complesso è abbastanza positiva mi trovo molto bene con la sicurezza e la comodità di
                    avere email foto video e documenti tutti nello stesso posto ma ha anche molte cose da migliorare
                    cominciando dallo spazio di archiviazione che purtroppo è limitato, il fatto che se crei una
                    cartella con dei documenti devi per forza cercarla dalla barra di ricerca/filtro perchè tra le
                    cartelle di sistema di icloud non la trovi e questo è molto fastidioso e poco pratico soprattutto se
                    lo usi per lavoro e devi trovare dei documenti in modo urgente.
Pros:  Il vantaggio più grande di
                    ICloud è la sicurezza, in quanto ha la sicurezza a due fattori e se passi da un dispositivo Apple ad
                    un altro ti mandano un codice di sicurezza o sul dispositivo apple oppure tramite sms, e subito dopo
                    ti richiede una parola chiave che puoi sapere solo tu. MI è piaciuto anche la facilità
                    nell'utilizzarlo e la sincronizzazione automatica dei documenti e delle foto e video.
Cons: La cosa che meno mi è
                    piaciuta di icloud è lo spazio di archiviazione limitato, se non fai l'abbonamento mensile o annuale
                    non ti fa più ricevere email e per lavoro è una cosa molto scomoda e disdicevole, anche se paghi hai
                    comunque uno spazio di archiviazione limitato (50gb al mese a 0.99 centesimi) e ciò lo trovo molto

Overall: Good for personal

Pros: Ease of use. Perfect for
                    personal photo storage and casual file storage in the cloud. Apple's emphasis on privacy is also a
                    plus. 
Cons: (1) Poor File Sharing
                    Features.
                    iCloud only allows single file sharing and has to do that by adding each collaborator on each single
                    shared file or folder. It does not come with the easy-sharing feature such as multi-selecting
                    files/folders and creating a file-sharing link like Dropbox offers to whoever has the link or the
                    link+passcode combo. This has set iCloud and Dropbox far apart. This could be ok to share some
                    simple files with few family members, but this sharing function has make it barely usable for
                    business purpose.

                    (2) No Document Management and Version Tracking Features
                    iCloud only provides the bare minimum basic file storage function and does not offer version
                    management functions like Dropbox does. The version management function is actually very important
                    to make iCloud usable for business.
                
Reasons for Choosing
                        iCloud: Just because I use iPhone and iCloud provides other good functions for personal
                    phone uses such as background backup. If only consider business functionality, iCloud is much less

Pros: I have been using iCloud
                    for more than 6 years now and I can definitely say that it is the best cloud service for Apple

Pros: The iCloud software helps

Cons: Internet dependency, to be

Overall: My overall experience
                    with iCloud has been good, and I will continue to use it. 
Pros: I like iCloud because it's
                    easy to use, and is native to all Apple devices. It makes it a no-brainer when you're using Apple
                    computers, iPads, or iPhones. And even when you're using some PC devices, it ports over rather well.
                
Cons: When using iCloud on a PC
                    or non-Mac device, it is a little bit more clunky, and not as seamless as when you're using a Mac

Verified LinkedIn User","""iCloud is simply the best""
Overall: It is fair to say
                    that iCloud is more than any other average cloud storage platform. It gives the best support to
                    backs up iPhone, iPad, and Mac data. It allows to access data from either a computer or mobile
                    device, and it is the best feature when you are away from your usual home base. Even if you lose
                    your device, the cloud data will not be lost. I changed phones but didn't lose any contacts, photos,
                    or other important stuff that I had on my phone. 
Pros: It is simply the best
                    platform when it comes to storing files and data on the cloud with great security features. It
                    allows accessing data from any location that is connected to the internet. You can easily share
                    files from the photo library as everything is seamlessly synchronized. You can manage your iCloud on
                    multiple devices and even locate a lost phone/tab. I personally love it for keeping track of my
                    calendar, bookmarks, and contacts. I have used it on my phone, tab, and mac system and it works
                    equally good on any device.
                
Cons: Life is good when you have
                    good internet connectivity but when you are in some remote area with low signals, the photos won't
                    load and makes your hair pull. I encountered this situation a couple of times and I was pretty
                    annoyed. So be mindful. The monthly storage subscription fee is low but still, it costs.",5,10-Aug,31-Jul-21

                    cloud storage manager""
Overall: Overall The key
                    message is that the system is one that is hard to avoid because of the seamless integration into
                    most Apple products, in addition to the multi functionality and integration within most if not all
                    major apps.
Pros: Ultimately what’s best
                    about this software is the fact that it is pretty user-friendly, and broadly accessible from a
                    variety of different devices. In addition can be accessible without direct Wi-Fi connection.
                    Therefore users can seamlessly access any of the required documents from virtually anywhere and from
                    any device. Integration between the majority of instilled apps is what allows this particular data
                    storage management to be ranked as a top-tier data storage software.
Cons: On the other hand, for
                    users who spend a large amount on the devices of selves, in particular Apple devices that have the
                    seamless integration it does seem a bit redundant to limit the amount of free storage that users
                    have access to and charge for additional storage although it is the storage management that is built
                    into the system. In addition I would recommend to further elaborate on the organizational aspects of
                    the folder system to allow users to add additional sub categories or sub tabs into their broad
                    folders .",4,10-Sep,14-May-22

Overall: Overall, iCloud is

Pros: One thing that I really
                    like about iCloud is the fact that everything is uploaded and stored automatically and you can have

Cons: Something that bothers me

Overall: iCloud is a great
                    cloud storage for my iPhone and can set my phone important data to be automatically backed up to the
                    cloud. 
Pros: I loved that iCloud storage
                    is not only stuck only on one standalone device, but can be access to from of my Apple device like
                    iPhone and iMac. It making the files sharing process between all of my device more smooth and can be
                    easily done. The uploading speed is also quite fast, almost the same as the download speed.
Cons: I hope more application on
                    my iPhone can be sync with the iCloud. For now, only native iPhone application can be linked with
                    the storage and other application will need manual process to saves the files to the iCloud. It is

                    digital limitations, but always with the help of Apple, which always solves it.
Pros: What I like most about
                    iCloud Is that I can view my documents and files from any Apple smart device under my account. It's
                    also easy to share these files with others, like my friends from college, who are in or have an

Cons: Some of the things I
                    dislike is that there are times when the file synchronization is very slow or never happens at all.
                    On the other hand, another thing that I don't like is that although iCloud has free storage, when it
                    runs out you have to buy more storage this is sometimes very expensive for people who study so they
                    can't afford it.

Overall: I would say overall I
                    would give iCloud good marks and am very happy with it. I do however think only 5GBs of ""basic""
                    level storage is too little; I feel Apple should offer more! I find it very fast, efficient and
                    stable so that makes my day personally and professional work well!
Pros: I primarily use iCloud as a
                    storage place for passwords, contacts and a choice amount of items (photos, music, etc.) in my
                    personal day to day world. I mostly find it to be simple and seamless but do find it fills up quick
                    and then the philosophical questioning of should I pay for more storage and how much do I need cross
                    my mind. As I mentioned below I had a major ""merge"" issue, but rank Apple's customer service in very
                    high regards for addressing and solving problems!
Cons: I think the pricing is a
                    bit much and there are times I prefer as much of the items I would potentially store on iCloud to
                    simply be on my hard drive and/or phone ONLY. Call it security fear but on occasion I think that way
                    and thus the price scares me off. I do not use a MAC anymore (back to PC) so the occasional sync
                    issues do occur. The biggest issue I ever had personally was when I left a job, had a separate
                    iCloud log in and had major issues merging the accounts.",4,10-Oct,18-Dec-20

                    it for the extra storage. One time i lost all my pictures from the whole year on my phone because i
                    did not have enough storage and i had to restart my phone, which really sucked. After that I

                    years for my mobile (iphone) and laptop (Macbook) devices. I like the fact that it has real-time
                    data syncing and the fact that it backs up both of my devices with the same files. For example,
                    instead of having to reinstall all of my data if I switch phones manually, I can simply connect the
                    new phone to iCloud and install the same setup/files in minutes. Super convenient. 
Cons: I don't have anything that
                    I don't necessarily like with iCloud. I've had no issues, no security problems and no accessibility
                    problems. 
Reasons for Switching to
                        iCloud: I do still use Google Drive but primarily on a limited basis because I cannot

Overall: It´s the best cloud

Pros: The best is that each

                    easy to use and you configure it from any gadget
Cons: Sometimes you don´t know if
                    the information is in the gadget or in iCloud, and whe you want to delete files, being in a computer

                    iCloud. Now my workflow is seamless, no matter what happens, no matter where I am.
Cons: I’m not sure I have a
                    con.... maybe that I can’t back up my music files, but that’s a personal issue.

Pros: There are so many things
                    you can utilize with iCloud, including messaging, file storage, etc. Our team communicates, in part,
                    through iCloud messaging, knowing these messages are stored in the cloud means it’s easy to go back
                    and check historical communications to ensure accountability and accuracy. 
Cons: At times, especially
                    through the actual site, it seems a bit clunky. The UI hasn’t changed in years, and it can throw
                    several errors when attempting to access iCloud mail. It’s just not as up to date as the rest of its

Stephanie S.,"""One of the Best Cloud Storage""
Overall: Overall if you have
                    multiple Apple devices iCloud storage would be something I would recommend because you're able to
                    sync your documents and photos and other stuff through multiple devices seamlessly. The customer
                    service is amazing so if you need any assistance you are able to get help.
Pros: iCloud is very convenient
                    if you have multiple Apple devices you're able to save a document on one device let's say on your
                    computer and then you're able to pull up the same document on your iPhone. Having iCloud storage
                    also is convenient if you have a lot of pictures because you're able to save a lot of pictures and
                    access them on different Apple devices. You're also able to share albums through iCloud with
                    relatives and friends which is an amazing feature. iCloud also allows you to purchase different
                    storage options so you are not limited to just one storage option so there are storage options for
                    just about everyone. 
Cons: What I don't like is that
                    the iPhone only comes with 5 GB of storage I really wish it was more because if you do use your
                    iPhone a lot 5 GB is not enough and you do have to purchase more storage.",4,10-Oct,7-May-22

                    pictures of myself and my friends because I lost them. Since switching to Apple products and trying

Pros: I am gonna keep this review
                    simple. Anyone who has used a Macbook or an iPhone once in their life has surely used iCloud. As the
                    name describes, this is a cloud storage platform coming from the house of Apple making your data
                    more accessible and saving the storage space on your devices. The UI is absolutely beautiful and I
                    love the fact that I don't have to worry about losing my photos or documents since iCloud
                    automatically syncs them to their servers. To get started all you need is an Apple ID and a
                    supported payment method and you are ready to go. There are alternatives like Dropbox and Google
                    Drive but I'd only recommended them to people using Windows Laptops or Android Smartphones. If you
                    are an Apple user trust me you won't regret trying this one! Go for it! 
Cons: When it comes to Cons there
                    is nothing wrong with the platform but I'd be really glad if they could extend their free storage to
                    atleast 20gb so that the users who can't afford to pay can enjoy the services as well. Else a little
                    price reduction doesn't hurt anyone! That's it!",4,10-Oct,20-Jun-23

Overall: Ultimately, as an
                    avid apple user, I love using iCloud because of its compatibility with all my devices. Anytime I
                    have an issue, I am able to contact apple support and get help immediately with no complications.
                    Also, iCloud is very convenient for me to use to save all my photos into one spot. With that being
                    said, iCloud is a software that takes time to adapt to and learn how to use. It may not be the best
                    software of choice if an individual is not tech savy. 
Pros: I really admire how each
                    individual with an Apply device gets free 5GB of storage in iCloud. This allows the user to test its
                    features and truly use it to see if they are interested in buying more storage after the 5GB. Icloud
                    is designed to be compatible with macOS and iOS devices but an added bonus is that it is also
                    compatible with Windows. Also, apple is known for having great customer service which is another
                    reason why I like to use iCloud. 
Cons: I find it more difficult to
                    share files with other users compared to Google Drive. Icloud is built specially for users with
                    apple devices, thus those with Androids cannot download this app. This places limitations on the
                    amount of users that can use this.",3,10-Oct,1-Dec-21

                    select them. If I intend to delete additional files, I'll have to choose only a handful at a time
                    and have to do it again for other files. I feel it is a system issue rather than a problem on my

Overall: I've never had an
                    issue using iCloud. 50 gb of cloud storage is inexpensive at about $1.50/month. This is a reasonable
                    monthly cost for peace of mind. I've used other cloud services in the past (Google One, One Drive)
                    and while they are all functional in terms of their intended purpose, iCloud is that much easier to
                    use.
Pros: The main pro about iCloud,
                    along with most cloud services is the access to my files. With my Apple ID, I can access my cloud
                    storage from any computer, anywhere in the world. The functionality of iCloud is made even better
                    when interacting with other Apple devices owned by the same person. Accessing files between your
                    owned Apple devices is seamless and only done faster when using AirDropping.
Cons: While the functionality
                    serves its purpose, the only con is accessing your files from a web browser. The service works, but
                    it is not as intuitive or easy as doing so from your owned devices.

Pros: iCloud is best to be linked

                    as my contact list, files and notes. Recovering my phones after any problem is easy as all the files
                    is saved on the cloud storage. 
Cons: I will not work best with
                    other operating system like android, because it will not unleash its full potential that iCloud has.
                    It will be great if iCloud is compatible with other operating system, and not only for Apple
                    product. Some of the file types for a video also not supported by this software.

Overall: iCloud can either be
                    great or it can be terrible. When everything is running smoothly, I have no complaints, but the more
                    work I do with iCloud, the more it seems to confuse the storage mechanism and its different versions
                    across devices. 
Pros: I like the synchronization
                    feature that automatically updates my work across multiple devices. I enjoy the fact that my
                    contacts, mail, notes, photos, etc. are linked together in cyberspace and can be accessed from any
                    of my devices whenever I need them. 
Cons: iCloud can be VERY
                    confusing at times, especially when operating on my iPhone--things get jumbled or copied
                    incorrectly, I have duplicates of certain items, music is missing, synchronization can be tricky.
                    Sometimes iCloud feels too big under its own weight, even when it's trying to go as small as
                    possible. When everything is saved under the iCloud umbrella, it inextricably links my documents and
                    media when I sometimes don't want it to.

                    On occasion, iCloud also doesn't recognize my devices, and I've been forced to change passwords more
                    often than I'd like. This has a ripple effect across devices and I'm usually forced to consult the
                    menu on my phone to change it; however, the options and menu user interface on iCloud's phone
                    version is also nebulous and leads to more problems. iCloud is best used sparingly and with the
                    least amount of finagling as possible--it feels like a hindrance more than an asset sometimes.",3,10-Jul,3-Nov-21

Pros: 1) Integrated into Mac,

                    has been edited on different devices.
                    3) Very fast. When I change a file on a local device it is instantly uploaded to iCloud.
                    4) Wonderful web interface: The interface for accessing your files via the web is wonderful. It is
                    almost as good as a native app with the exception of it being a little slow.

                    a compeitive price.
Cons: iCloud only has one
                    drawback which is the lack of the ability to set your own encryption key for your files.
                    In many ways this is only a minor issue because Apple have exceptional security. However, if someone

Christopher M.,"""Easy cloud-based file storage and sharing""
Pros: iCloud supports users in
                    two key ways. First, it allows users to store their mac files remotely, which means that someone
                    working from home on a desktop could then arrive at work and use an alternate desktop/laptop to
                    access the same files, as if using the same computer. Second, it operates as a potential backup. I
                    spilled water on my laptop and it wouldn't turn back on. I quickly turned on another computer that
                    also shared my iCloud files, and all of my work--including what I had just been developing--showed
                    up. If it weren't for iCloud, I wouldn't have those files anymore.
Cons: The sharing is designed to
                    be seamless, but as a result there are limited ways in which users can easily select or make
                    modifications to what is stored in iCloud and what is not. This is a result of Apple wanting to make
                    the experience as invisible and frictionless as possible, but as a user who likes to modify my
                    software to suit my needs, I wouldn't mind a bit more hands-on control.",3,10-Oct,23-Sep-20

Overall: Overall, I have had a

                    a customer already has an Apple product, they should automatically be entitled to more storage and
                    for free.

                    Also, I like how I can access iCloud through any web browser by utilizing the iCloud website. This
                    has helped me when I have needed files from my iCloud but was using my assigned Chromebook when I
                    was in high school. This feature does not serve me that much now but I understand how it can be

                    because I usually purchase iPhones with the least amount of storage.
Cons: I do not like how expensive
                    iCloud can be in comparison to its competitors such as Google Drive, which offers more space for
                    free. Right now, I have an iCloud plan that is $0.99/month and it can only do so much. My phone is

Cons: I believe that the storage
                    capacity in the free model could be a little bigger since we often use iCloud on both iPhones and
                    Macbooks, with two devices storing documents in one account.

Pros: iCloud is the best cloud

                    possessed like iPhone and MacBook. It will centralized the storage that i can access files that i

Cons: I wish they can offered
                    more option for the paid plan and introduce a one time payoff. It can be lower in the storage size,
                    as long it is not paid for a monthly or yearly subscription. Apart of this, anything else if fine.

Christopher S.,"""Great Storage for a particular ecosystem""
Overall: Overall icloud is
                    great if you want to stick to apple products.
Pros: What I like most about
                    icloud is that like all apple products it works automatically with my apple products such as my
                    macbook pro, imac, and iphone. If you already have apple devices, there's no need to do anything
                    else for your cloud storage solution.
Cons: What I like least about
                    icloud is the overall tiers when it comes to storage. Other providers offer a lot more free storage
                    out of the gate. The free tier for icloud is only 5 gb. What makes things worse is that a lot of
                    service are automatically backed up to icloud, so before you know it you are being pestered to pay
                    for more storage. While I like that it is integrated into apple products, I started using another
                    cloud service. As a small business that specializes in technology, I wanted something that was
                    versatile enough to work with different OS's. That's not to say that icloud can't, but like most
                    apple products it isn't really designed to play well with others.",5,10-Sep,18-Aug-21

Overall: Molto positiva, un
                    grande vantaggio gratuito per gli utenti iOS 
Pros: iCloud si integra benissimo
                    con tutti i dispositivi Apple, non solo smartphone.
                    Utile perché memorizza anche i promemoria, e non solo i file.
                    Sicuramente uno dei vantaggi principali è che è gratuito per gli utilizzatori Apple, fino ai 5GB. Ma
                    soprattutto ho trovato molto utile il fatto che collabori nel tracciare un iPhone smarrito
Cons: È molto facile raggiungere
                    i 5GB di archi azione gratuita, quindi si è quasi obbligati a pagare il piano a pagamento.
                    Inoltre si integra molto male con i sistemi Android, se si passa da iOS ad Android, è probabile

Verified LinkedIn User","""Amazing Online Storage for IOS Users""
Overall: I can almost say
                    Apple and iCloud really matched, your data is safe and this is a very reliable platform.
Pros: iCloud has been everyone's
                    best friend when it comes to storing your data if you are an IOS user, as we all know iPhone has
                    limited data storage depending on how many Gig your device is. Since it's not an expandable device,
                    I always rely on this one in terms of storing my data including important photos, video memories,
                    and also favorite applications. Instead of paying a high amount of data storage on the device you
                    will purchase which will cause you an ample amount of money, this is a highly suggested platform
                    that will save you a lot. 
Cons: If you are an IOS user,
                    once you messed up with your iCloud password you can possibly lose all of your data including your
                    device since you cannot bypass it once your device has undergone an iCloud password Issue. So better

Overall: Great experience so
                    far. 9/10 recommended.
Pros: iCloud comes with all
                    iPhones, Macs, iPads and Apple watches and once you have one apple device, the iCloud sign in you
                    use can be used for all your devices. This saves a great deal of time because you don't have to
                    worry about making new accounts with different emails and passwords. Once I have photos and files
                    saved to cloud, I can really easily access them by entering my login information. Saving items onto
                    iCloud is like having backup in case google drive or Microsoft 365 doesn't work one day. None of my
                    uploaded files and documents have ever been missing which shows that iCloud is very reliable. iCloud
                    is also relatively easy to learn to use. Learning will take a bit of time but once you learn it, it
                    is so efficient and useful the time you spend on it is 100% worth it.
Cons: There is a cost associated
                    with iCloud once you are over the allotted GB. You get notifications about how iCloud isn't working
                    and are basically forced to pay. I think the price is worth it for the services iCloud gives.",3,10-Oct,17-Mar-23

                    on and on! All I had to do was sign in on my new device with my iCloud and everything was there. It
                    made losing my piece of equipment a breeze and everything had been stored and restored
                    automatically, without my lifting a finger (other than to sign in). I'd recommend iCloud without
                    reservation. 
Pros: iCloud is easy to use
                    because it's automatic!! I love that iCloud is not something I have to actively use, but rather
                    upkeeps saving things for me on it's own. I recently lost my device and when I got a new one, I had
                    EVERYTHING saved. I cannot imagine if I had lost all that was on my device.

                    wish that it had costed less- however in comparing with other softwares, I realize it's very

                    artifacts available when and where they are needed.
Pros: The best characteristics of
                    iCloud are automated synchronization of files across multiple platforms (mobile, MacOS, and
                    Windows). The synchronization works transparently on each platform and is a big boost to
                    productivity.
Cons: iCloud works very well, is
                    secure, and effective. It would be nice to access iCloud from a third-party party more traditional
                    backup solution to have a redundant copy of artifacts. Being a proprietary service makes iCloud more
                    secure but also introduces a single point of failure should something go wrong with the access or

                    back up your photo library and videos to an external hard drive for safety. 
Pros: The pros about iCloud is
                    that all of my Apple products from my Iphone, iMac, Ipad etc are linked to one place. I do like that
                    I can just log on and my photos and videos from my devices are all in one place. 
Cons: There are a lot of things

                    this day and age, people are constantly on their phones and storage becomes a huge issue.

                    that, there have been no fault with the technology. iCloud definitely will get the job done and is
                    such a common medium.
Pros: iCloud is fantastic at
                    connecting with all of your Apple devices and synchronizing quickly. Apple is always very good at
                    connecting your devices and fulfills all of the basic necessities for cloud storage. Great
                    encryption as well.
Cons: Apple has such an
                    influential name and brand following that they do not always hold up to competition. There are many
                    other forms of storage that can hold much more than iCloud does and has greater capabilities for a
                    lesser price, or even offer way more for the free version. iCloud is so ingrained within any apple
                    device that the company can offer less without backlash.",3,10-May,13-Apr-23

Pros: You can download some datas

Cons: ICloud usages are very
                    small even no cannot download everything.

Pros: Integrating Icloud for

                    Apple ecosystem ""
Overall: Overall, we've been
                    pretty happy with iCloud as one of our backup storage options. Pricing of storage is pretty
                    comparable to its peers like Google and Dropbox, so it makes it an easy choice in that department.
                    While we wish access on non-Apple devices was a little easier and more streamlined, it's not a big
                    enough dealbreaker to make us switch to a different platform wholesale. 
Pros: My favorite thing about
                    iCloud is how deeply integrated it is with our MacOS and iOS devices. iCloud is native on Apple
                    devices, so it is very easy to access and use. It is intuitively designed and pretty easy to use, so
                    most of our team members like it and don't have any issues. 
Cons: Access on non-Apple devices
                    is a little clunky. While it works, iCloud is obviously designed for use primarily on Apple devices.
                
Reasons for Choosing

Cons: The only con is that fact
                    that apple could have more storage in their phones. iCloud is another way for Apple to make more

Pros: I do like iCloud software

Cons: There are a couple of
                    points that I think should be improved.
                    1. In backup files, if it is possible to choose the file's content to backup this could be helpful.

Pros: It came as part of my Apple

                    for over a decade. It automatically saved everything in icloud. I often updated IOS software and
                    often managed storage on it for smooth working on iphone and ipad. So as such it's impressive,
                    inbuilt on Apple devices.
Cons: I found it scary as could
                    never be clear how to use it. Is it a drive or what? Where the data gets stored. I heard many
                    stories around of people losing their data as they may pressed a wrong button. I too always remained

Pros: I really appreciate that

                    and have switched to Google Business Drive for all our storage and file needs. 
Pros: iCloud (and earlier
                    versions) was great when we first started using it around 2006. their gallery and photo features we
                    like nothing else on the market. Their email product is probably the feature we use the most,
                    providing three separate emails to use (@mac / @me / @icloud). 
Cons: Over the last twenty years
                    many of the features on iCloud have disappeared (like the cool gallery feature) and now the storage
                    area has limits and becomes very expensive. We decided to use Google Business Drive as they provide

Overall: I own a lot of apple
                    products, so I use iCloud a lot. It is very easy to set up and use as long as the device has
                    internet connections. 
Pros: I used both Apple iCloud
                    and Google One to store my photos. I would give 8/10 to Apple iCloud overall. It has good interface,
                    secure encryption, and unified integration with the Apple ecosystem. All photos can be synchronous
                    on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook, and I have 5GB of free cloud storage.
Cons: Many people complained that
                    Apple iCloud has no search function for photos in web interface, which bothers me a bit as well.
                    Also, the paid plans of iCloud is slightly more expensive than Google One. iCloud offers between
                    $0.99 for 50GB/ month of storage and $9.99/ month for 2TB, but Google One has $99.99/year for 2TB.",5,10-May,4-Feb-22

                    bought my iphone last couple of years , its good overall it gets the job done but nothing fancy .
                
Pros: This software is so easy to

Overall: It's not terribly

                    that, other cloud drive solutions are far more intuitive
Pros: I like that it backs up all
                    my devices and keeps them in sync. It gives me peace of mind that my devices can get destroyed and
                    replacements should work just about identically
Cons: It's designed to work in
                    the background to the point that I barely know what it's up to. Managing and retrieving what's being
                    stored outside of device backups is un-intuitive. Obviously it's possible but I can grab and share

Zandrich M.,"""Apple is nothing without iCloud""
Overall: Over the course of my
                    use of iCloud since its implementation, the service has expanded significantly to address the
                    changing needs of Apple users over the years. The functions that allow restoring user settings and
                    preferences is by far my favourite, and has saved me countless hours of tweaking following the
                    usually difficult switch to a new device.
Pros: It's hard to imagine using
                    an Apple device without iCloud; the service has proven to be indispensable since its introduction -
                    user data in all forms, from files and documents to settings, preferences and messages, are all
                    conveniently saved to iCloud to be retrieved by the owner at any time, from any device.

                    At the heart of iCloud is a robust, infallible suite of security and encryption protocols, making
                    private data irretrievable by any means other than authentication.
Cons: It's difficult to fault a
                    free service like iCloud; even without purchasing additional storage, the standard plan provided
                    offers more than enough functionality and storage for typical use.

                    When it comes to the purchase of additional storage, iCloud is priced competitively in first-world
                    markets, but weighs in on the pricier side in other regions.",3,10-May,22-Jul-21

                    keychain in order to make an Apple-like product. Not the current one, but something as clever and
                    graphically attractive as 1Password. 
Pros: iCloud is a good service
                    and it allows you to keep all your main data in sync across all over your Apple devices. I have been

Pros: It is a tool that allows

                    else""
Overall: iCloud is great cloud
                    storage that offers remote file redundancy which is extremely important to me as a business owner. I
                    use it primarily to store Mac-generated files (such as Pages docs and Keynote presentations), but I
                    imagine it's just as capable at storing all kinds of files as it's competitors.
Pros: I love that this product
                    functions the way it is supposed to. It's easy to understand, it's intuitive, and everything works
                    the way you'd expect it to. There's no guessing here, just a solid, competitive product that does
                    what it's advertised to do and does it well.
Cons: The one thing I dislike
                    about this is very specific to my OS preferences, because I prefer Android mobile devices over
                    Apple's, the integration is not as smooth, so I opt for Google drive which integrates well with my
                    MacBook Pro and seamlessly with my Google Pixel 3XL
Alternatives Considered:

Reasons for Choosing
                        iCloud: Ultimately, I actually chose Drive over iCloud but kept iCloud as a backup

Overall: I share my 200GB

                    use icloud links and send to my friends. So I don't need to send whole file.
Pros: It's always accessible,
                    secure and flexible. It's secure for me, 2FA with SMS is really OK for me and like that.
                    I do not need to worry for my iPhones memory. With a little price, I keep files online with my

Cons: Web interface is not as

Verified LinkedIn User","""I wished iMessages were not locked to iCloud""
Pros: It is easy to use. As you
                    might already know, iCloud comes with all iOS devices. Thus, no setup is needed. You can also access
                    it from any Apple device and as well over a desktop. It's nice to have that integration.
Cons: The basic package only
                    comes with 5 gigabytes which are really not enough. I also don't like that Apple locks iMessage and
                    other apps (such as WhatsApp) to only sync with iMessage. Cloud storage is honestly so cheap
                    nowadays (for instance, Amazon Photo is FREE with Amazon Prime or OneDrive being only $2.99 for 100
                    gigabytes), that it seems absurd for what iCloud is charging.

Pros: If you happen to have

                    devices use the same account. This results in you getting DOZENS of notifications every day telling
                    you to upgrade and its very discouraging. If Apple doesn't start playing ball soon, they could end
                    up tanking as a company, especially with Jobs gone. 
Pros: Fast, decent price, and
                    works well with Apple devices. The problem is that it doesn't work well with non-Apple devices at
                    all. 
Cons: I really wish Apple wasn't
                    so stubborn. Being closed off to other operating systems may give them a little short term profit,
                    but it is going to hurt their reputation in the long run. I think less of Apple because of their
                    refusal to play ball with other companies and because of them stiffing their customers by refusing
                    to move their phones to usb C even though they forced their laptops into it too early. This kind of
                    mindset leaks into the iCloud use because it isn't compatible with as many devices. That is why I
                    switched to google drive.",5,10-Sep,1-Nov-20

Sashana B.,"""I Love Using iCloud!""
Overall: Before I used iCloud,
                    I always had issues with data storage software. iCloud has simplified this task, and has definitely
                    made my life easier and backing up my data hassle free. 
Pros: iCloud is so easy to access
                    and use. Everything is really straightforward. I recently became an iPhone user and thought that the
                    process of setting everything up would be complex. It turned out that it was the complete opposite!
                    All you need is an Apple ID and you can set up your iCloud using that ID.
                    I've found iCloud to be really useful. I have used iCloud to manage my emails, photos and other
                    media and contacts. But I have particularly loved using iCloud backup for the apps and data on my
                    phone.
                    As a freelance makeup artist and full-time law student, there are many apps, documents and files
                    that I have to manage and store so that they're quickly and easily accessible whenever I have need
                    of them. iCloud has definitely been a useful tool in my daily life, and I love that I don't have to
                    keep checking to ensure that my data is backed up. It also really helps that I can access my backed
                    up data from any of my devices once I've logged in to iCloud.
                    Additionally, while Apple allows individuals 5GB of free storage space, persons who want more space
                    can upgrade their iCloud storage at really affordable monthly rates.
Cons: My first time using iCloud
                    on my laptop was a bit confusing, but I really just needed to get used to the interface. The labels
                    and icons are pretty accurate and the software is quite simple and to-the-point. So, in light of
                    that, I think it has the right amount of features to make it effective for the purposes of data
                    storage.",4,10-Sep,24-Feb-22

Pros: The integration with the

                    pricing when compared to other alternatives. One thing that really makes it an option for me, is the
                    end-to-end encryption that keeps your privacy on top of the priorities for Apple.
Cons: The pricing could have more
                    options, you only have 5GB, 200GB and then a huge jump to 2TB. I think that should be available more
                    diversity of tier options. The sharing tools for non-Apple users could make it hard for them to

Overall: Excellent.
Pros: Suitable as a backup for
                    documents, photos and other forms of data.

                    My favorite case use for iCloud are the numerous apps that integrate with it. There are apps that
                    have my notes from clients conferences, to do lists, photos, documents, emails, and they integrate
                    with iCloud, hence all my stuff is safely backed up to to the cloud. What's even better I don't have
                    to manually back up anything, it's done automatically.

                    iCloud is also expensive so I don't have to break bank.

Cons: Accessing files on a non

Overall: I am a huge fan of
                    Apple products includng iCloud. I find ease of use a big bonus with all Apple products and programs.
                
Pros: I like that iCloud has
                    direct integrtion with my iPhone and all my Apple products.
Cons: The only thing I don't
                    really care for with iCLud is it costs additonal monies. With the cost of Apple products iCloud, no
                    matter how much starage is needed should be included in the cost of the products.",3,10-Oct,5-Apr-23

Overall: I have been using

                    one place. It makes it easier to get a new phone because all of you stuff is in iCloud
Pros: I love that iCloud saves
                    all of my things from all of my devices. I can type something on my iPad and find it on my phone
                    later

                    little slow, but that could be because of my slow internet.",5,10-Sep,31-Jul-23

Overall: Helpful tool to save
                    phone storage. 
Pros: iCloud features some
                    amazing tools: I started out with one Iphone, now our entire family as well as office is Apple. I
                    love the fact that iCloud makes it possible to have the same files, notes, photos, calender on each
                    phone, laptop, Ipad etc. 
Cons: Some features are
                    complicated to me: for example the set up as to which data will be shared with which household etc.
                    Usually my husband gets all the settings figured out for me and then I'm good to go. 
Reasons for Switching to

                    because it makes me feel truly protected when it comes to the storage and security of our files.
                
Pros: I've been able to save and
                    access crucial papers on a variety of devices, such as my resume or application, thanks to this
                    software. It functions on phones, tablets, and laptops.

Meghan R.,"""Great tool to save information & photos""
Overall: Overall, the product
                    is good and definitely worth it. It saves important information that may be taking up too much space
                    on whatever product you are using (iPad, iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and more. I really like this product
                    and I probably will continue to use it for years as long as I have my iPhone. 
Pros: The main reason I like
                    iCloud is the ability to save a lot of my information from my iPhone and download that information
                    to my computer. This allows me to keep photos on my laptop and delete the photos from my phone so
                    that I make more storage room for newer photos/etc. I really like that I don’t have to worry about
                    losing important information because I can download it to iCloud to save for later. 
Cons: One thing I do not like is
                    that I have a hard time deleting the files all at once when I want to get rid of things. It’s a one
                    by one process which takes a long time. Also iCloud can be frustrating at first to figure out. It
                    wasn’t very user friendly for me at first until I got the hang of it.",5,10-Oct,21-Sep-21

Anastacia G.,"""iCloud Fan""
Overall: Overall, I love using
                    iCloud. I've worked for other agencies in the past that had this whole extensive software/system
                    upgrade process that seemed like files still got lost... well we have peace of mind with the iCloud
                    because nothing gets lost in the shuffle and that's great for us that manage client data and
                    information on a day-to-day basis. 
Pros: I love how easy and simple
                    it was to change systems via iCloud. We switch out laptops every 2 years and with iCloud, we
                    literally just open an app, click start transfer, and Boom - we're on our way to a brand new system!
                    it's great! 
Cons: It can be a little
                    complicated when we have a few IT issues. As with any organization, there are always going to be a
                    few people who just happen to have bad luck or didn't follow instructions quite well and end up
                    needing extra support. That's when it can get very challenging to diagnose an issue because iCloud

                    probably be lost without icloud…I have gone through a few computers & phones in the past &
                    ended up losing so many special photos and videos and files, and since using icloud-I never have to
                    worry about that again. 
Pros: I like that I can
                    automatically have things stored to icloud, rather than going through photos or files and manually
                    selecting what I’d like to save. I enjoy that it’s easy to access from numerous devices
Cons: The only issue I have found
                    myself facing is running out of storage-though that is my own doing, really. It’d be nice if it were
                    free to upgrade storage-but it’s worth paying a small amount for.",4,10-Sep,24-Feb-22
Saurabh S.,"""iCloud Review""
Overall: Using this iCloud, it
                    is quite simple to move any data from an old iPhone to a new iPhone. I think that many customers are
                    deterred from moving to android smart phones by iCloud.
Pros: I enjoy that I just need
                    one location to manage my digital cloud storage, which I use to store my iPhone and iPad's contact
                    information, files, and documents. I don't need to manually uploading them over the USB cord
                    every-time I require files on my iPhone to my Mac Book. Everything becomes highly mobile and fluid
                    as a result.
Cons: Free storage space is quite
                    constrained, and it costs a lot of money to increase it so that you can save all of your images and
                    movies. We could save some money if we could choose the images and movies that were preserved in

Pros: ICloud is a wonderful

                    were unable to restore their lost files or find it hard to access their documents across devices.
                    Naturally, anyone using iPhone for the first time might struggle with a thing or two at first. It,
                    however, gets easier the more time you spend using it.

                
Pros: iCloud is a great tool for
                    storing and retrieving information across devices. With an interface that is user-friendly, it makes
                    it easy for anyone to use. It is also the dominant storage software on all Apple products, iPhone,
                    iPad and Macbook. This means it is hard to not find at least someone you know who uses it,
                    especially for business. It is also far more than just storing documents and files, it also allows
                    users to access their files, recover them, collaborate with several other platforms for easy access.

                
Cons: Like all other products,
                    iCloud is not pleasing to me and several users in this way -- the iCloud premium package is a

                    synchronization is amazing. Your data gets synced immediately without requiring additional
                    managment. 
Cons: It is very complicated to
                    manage the storage. It looks like you have enough space, but application tells you you do not. When
                    you want to see the details of the storage, there are so many different pages with so many details.

Pros: I like the software because
                    we can keep or save our datas or personal files thru back-up and keep them for longer time. It
                    stores all our important pictures or documents securely. But you still can share your photos or
                    files. 
Cons: iCloud have files have
                    payment when uploading and you cannot retrieve/share your files when there is no internet connection
                    because it is dependent on internet or it is an internet based. iCloud also has its limit in

                    never had privacy or security issues. 
Pros: I appreciate that this back
                    up system is here for emergencies and when new devices are being installed. I think the value is
                    also quite worth it. For $1 I have been able to get 50 gb of storage for many years and it has
                    successfully restored my photos, videos, music, and more onto new phones. 
Cons: My least favorite features

                    space very consistently. Also, maybe a bit more storage space for each account would be better,

Overall: iCloud is a
                    lifesaver. I haven't carried my laptop with me for the past year and it's been great. I can take a
                    photo on my iPhone, edit it, and then email it to my manager all from iCloud. It is so easy to use
                    and I never have to worry about breaking down or forgetting something at home as iCloud syncs most
                    of the things.
Pros: I can't say enough nice
                    things about this product. It's stable, efficient, and incredibly smooth to use. But it's so much
                    more than that: it's trustworthy and secure too! Every time I'm away from my computer, I don't worry
                    about the files I've been working on because they're safely backed up and accessible no matter what.
                    I'm so grateful for this product.
Cons: I was really excited about
                    iCloud when I first signed up for it. It's been good but I have found that it doesn't always load
                    the files correctly and takes just a little too long to get them done. The thing I like least,

Overall: In my personal
                    experience with iCloud, I think it is an excellent service if you are part of the Apple ecosystem,
                    because of the good integration it has with the other applications, it seems to me the best cloud
                    storage option. Space expansion prices do not seem exaggerated either. iCloud is a very good
                    service.
Pros: One of the best things that
                    iCloud has is its synchronization, it works really well between devices, the handling of data and
                    documents is safe, which is great. But the best thing about iCloud is its integration with the Apple
                    ecosystem, it is essential for the proper functioning of other IOS applications.
Cons: I don't like the
                    optimization it does on non-Apple devices, it works very slow and many features are lost along the
                    way. The web version of iCloud is very poorly optimized.

Pros: iCloud is a online data

                    icloud account. Starting with contacts and notes and ending with pictures and videos.
Cons: You can only use its full
                    potential when you use it on Apple devices, because all the hidden features do not work in other

                    for what it is. I have no trouble navigating through the app and organizing the things I put on
                    there. Overall, it’s a solid great app.
Pros: I like how secure iCloud is
                    about your data and how fast it can upload any thing and share it across all your devices including
                    your phone or laptop.
Cons: What I least like about
                    iCloud is the storage. It’s not really great if you have the free storage but if you buy extra
                    storage. It can be useful because of all the things you can store on it.",4,10-Oct,12-Feb-22
Daniel L.,"""Cheap and Effective""
Overall: It has been a
                    wonderful way to store and securely keep data, documents, pictures, etc. I find it to be the most
                    effective cloud storage in the market and would not choose any other platform for my apple devices.
                
Pros: It has a cheap cost per
                    month to store up to 50gb which is usually all I need. This allows me to store all of my pics and
                    documents within one space but on each of my devices.
Cons: I wish there was a segway
                    between the 50gb and the next option up. Google cloud offers more versatile pricing options.",5,10-Jun,22-Dec-21

Overall: In general, there's
                    no other option other than iCloud when it comes to Apple ecosystem, since it is tightly integrated

Cons: It is relatively

Reasons for Choosing

Overall: I upgraded to a paid
                    plan when I needed to Backup my iPhone before taking it to an Apple Store for a potential hardware
                    issue - in the event I had needed a new phone as a result, the Backup would have been a live saver
                    for the years of data and photos stored on my device. 
Pros: iCloud has a number of
                    features that any Apple user may want to consider signing up for. With iCloud, I can access the
                    photos from my iPhone on any of my devices. I was potentially worried about the security of iCloud,
                    but reading into it eased any concerns, and it seems to be quite secure with your Apple ID. iCloud
                    backs up much of the data on your device, and it is easy enough to set up what you want - and what
                    you don't want - stored in the iCloud from your phone or applicable device.
Cons: I have Messages running on
                    both my iPhone and my MacBook Air under my Apple ID. My iPhone was storing messages for one year
                    only while my Air had messages spanning back 4 years. When I upgraded to the paid iCloud option,
                    Messages synced and I lost all of my old messages from my Air. It also wasn't clear how much of your

Pros: All Apple users must use
                    the iCloud for several reasons, the most important of which is to control the space of your device

Overall:  iCloud is a powerful

                    their data from anywhere, at any time, and from any device.
Pros: Apple Inc. provides the
                    cloud-based storage and computing tool known as iCloud. It enables users to view data stored on a

Cons: If you have a lot of data

Overall: My overall experience
                    with iCloud has been great as there is the highest reliability of the data not being lost.
Pros: I use iCloud extensively to
                    back up and store some important data permanently and to transfer some of the not very important
                    backed up data to my hard drive so that I don't have to keep purchasing extra space and pay extra.
                    There is a risk of losing data in case the hard disk is lost, unlike the iCloud storage where there
                    is higher reliability that the data isn't lost.
Cons: The least I like about this

                    10+ years by now and has been a huge staple for most Apple users from iPhone, iPad and Mac
                    computers. It is a great resource with simple tools to grab anything from the cloud on any Apple
                    device or devices signed into an Apple account. 
Cons: It is free, but for higher
                    storage capacities it can be a bit unreasonably upscaled in price compared to other similar cloud
                    systems like Google. Granted, iCloud paved the way for the rest more or less.",3,10-Jun,3-Jun-21

                    with me.
Pros: Sharing files and the
                    accessibility to access files is a breeze with this software. I highly recommend using this for
                    either work or personal because it is relatively inexpensive and you have what you need at the palm
                    of your hands. 
Cons: The downfall to this
                    product is that it is only for Apple products. I only use and own Apple so it is easy for me for

Cons: Everythings' fine but the

Overall: I have stopped
                    relying on iCloud. It's too confusing to navigate.
Pros: iCloud is convenient
                    because it overlaps between devices... but I personally feel it is tedious and not user friendly by
                    any means - can't think of many pros to be honest. 
Cons: I've mostly stopped using
                    icloud for storage. It is really limited data storage and I don't trust automatic updates so I
                    instead back up manually on a hard drive. I also put things in Google drive because that stores a
                    lot more, and is so much easier to organize files. I constantly get notified with iCloud that I'm
                    out of storage and just really feel it's not worth it to keep paying more for more storage. iCloud
                    overall is not user friendly and hard to navigate... my parents and grandparents are always asking
                    why they get iCloud notifications and I never know how to help them! While I love Apple and Apple

Overall: Overall, I liked
                    iCloud mainly because it backs up the photos really well. You don't have to delete the photos to

                    the best option to backup the device files and photos. Works great when you have iPad and Mac (which
                    I have). Recently updated iCLoud+ offers many more features like email hiding.

Pros: I am a big fan of Apple

Cons: The bad part of iCloud or

                    honestly think it's overboard. It makes it difficult for users to setup their devices, simply

Pros: Being an avid user of Apple

                    are disappointing and deceitful. I don't wish to also pay Apple every month for email and storage

                    icloud email in 3 mins. I can move all my Android over easily and have storage beyond belief.

Reasons for Switching to
                        iCloud: I was given an iPad mini and finally decided to switch over. Files are not in 3
                    locations and sometimes hard to locate. Right there where and when I need them. Not searching my own
