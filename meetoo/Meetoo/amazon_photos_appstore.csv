Trinity the Cat,12/6/2022 3:21,"Iâm able to make albums and even edit photos right in the app to fit the wide format of the echo screen. I can use the albums as slide shows on my echo devices so that each one is personalized. I can share photos remotely on my momâs echo, this is priceless. She is 94 and really appreciates seeing the photos I upload for her. 

The app is not intuitive but I have been able to manage using it, and until I finally figured out how to get back to the main group of photos I would just exit out of the app and restart, but I have since then figured out how to do it. 

I donât allow access to my entire photo library on my phone because I only want to upload certain photos and not need to search through hundreds of photos, sometimes it is a little finicky on that and I have to do it more than once. Sometimes later Iâll have duplicate photos.

Robbinsk,1/3/2023 15:32,"Cons: I uploaded 7,000+ photos & the app is very laggy when I scroll through them. It frequently freezes so I have to close the app & re-open it to continue scrolling which is a pain to find where I left off & continue - knowing itâs just going to freeze again. The further into my photos I get, the more annoying it gets to re-find my place after a freeze. Second con is if you try to edit your photos through the app (basic stuff like cropping), half of the time it wonât save the image and you canât exit so, again, you have to close down the app & reopen it & try again. If it doesnât refuse to save itâll starts to save, but will freeze halfway through âuploadingâ the saved image & yet again you have to close down the app. All very annoying.  
Pro: it saves a lot of space on my phone being able to upload all my photos (but not my videos because I would have had to pay for storage if I did that). I like how when you upload photos it automatically stores them in order to the time stamp on the photo & you can easily search by date.

Thatâs very helpful for me, also I find how you can do the location (find a photo that way) is very helpful. One more thing I like is that you CAN delete the photos added, like maybe you donât like them, but they save to this app, you can just delete them. Now the thing I do dislike, when you press on the person, just photos show up no videos, which I find a bit annoying. Another than this, I love this app, and I ð¯ recommend it.

After I sign it, it usually works for 3 or 4 days, then will be stuck ""checking"" for x-amount of pictures, never loads them and then I either have to sign out and sign back in or delete the app and download it again. Then when I login, it's stuck on the login page for about 12 hours, then is on a blank white page for about 12 hours, then everything is fine and it works for a few days before I have to repeat the process again. I have some photos that it has never backed up and it apparently never will because even when I tell it to upload them, it gets stuck and they still never backup.

Instead you have to upload them to the general photo roll, then go in to the album, and select them all over again to add them to the folder.

- First, the facial recognition has never been great. Itâs always combined multiple family members into one. The plus of the old version was that I could manually override the person tag. Now, Iâm stuck with whatever tag the app automatically assigns. This makes it difficult, as I like to make different albums for my individual children. Now my sons are lumped together under the same person tag and I canât separate them. 

- Second, the user interface is unfriendly. Itâs difficult to find any feature thatâs not looking at a picture or a memory.

I edit most of my photos on iPad so its great as I can just import them from camera and back them up here and my hard drive.

Yuls24,5/25/2018 7:32,"* Review updated

I started using the app after several days which were necessary to upload all the photos from my phone. There are definitely nice features. I like that the app offers you to look at the pics that were taken on the same day previous years.
My biggest disappointment, however, is that the app backs up pictures as soon as they are taken (if wi-fi is available) and doesnât update them if they are being edited. I take quite a few pics a day and, at the end of it, I edit the best of them. If they were baked up some time earlier in the day, they remain unchanged. 
I was hoping that Prime Photo could be a free (well, I pay for prime either way) substitute of iCloud, but, unfortunately, it canât. As soon as I get a new phone, am I supposed to edit a couple thousand pics again?!

***
I havenât really started using the app yet, but Iâm already frustrated. I have lots of pictures on my phone - around 8 thousand. I know it takes time to copy/back them up, but not that much! The app was running a few hours at night and several hours in the morning, it managed to back up only a half! My phone barely works when itâs running and they want you to keep the app open for it to work faster which means I canât use my phone at all. I stopped myself from deleting the app several times already. I hope in a few days itâs gonna download all the pics so I could finally check out all the features.",3,False,Still have to use iCloud,,

You should easily be able to straighten a page without manually doing it. Auto capture is great but not all pages will be exactly flat please allow for skewed or off angles folds etc and correct easily.

FaerieOwl,5/23/2023 19:27,"This app does a wonderful job of packing up all my photos off of my phone or my iPad. It usually does it automatically, but sometimes I have to open the app for it to back up all the photos. This is not a hardship, just one tap on the app and it opens. I wish in the People part of the app it would allow me to choose the pictures that it sorts into peopleâs names, because it always puts my sisterâs pictures in my name and will not let me change that. For me thatâs the only problem with this app. Otherwise Iâm really thrilled with it.

Update:
For almost a year now the backup function is spotty at best. Some photos and movies get backed up, but some do not. If I take 2 photos of the same thing, one gets backed up and the other doesnât.

After it did what it did, I tried to reselect the same photo.. well where is the upload section? Itâs hidden in settings.. why is this the location for such an important function? I had to google where it was FYI.

At this point I am desperate to add photos to my echo show because I have a party to host.. so here I am selecting photos with over 11k photos without a way to narrow it down...

The other issue I have encountered is that it is no longer recognizing my canon raw files after processing them through Lightroom (CR2 files). The problem just started in the last month so I am not sure the issue. However this would be a major negative if it canât store canon raw files. 

Itâs by no means perfect. The information and instruction on use is lacking which in my case lead to a major error. In one case, I eliminated a folder on prime, only to discover that that action also deleted the original file on the hard drive. Luckily I had the raw files still on the memory card.

Elwood_37,11/4/2017 20:33,"This is almost a great program. However, it falls short in a number of crucial ways.

Firstly, there is no way to correct the many mistakes the facial recognition software makes. When it fails to recognize that an image contains a person, I canât manually tag it. Whatâs worse, it frequently misidentifies two or three people as being the same person, and thereâs no way to manually disambiguate. This is an essential function that must be added, and which competitor programs already have.

Frustratingly, the facial recognition 'People' folders index only the photos uploaded by your own account. They leave out all the photos of the same people in the family vault. So itâs not a very useful compilation of all the photos of somebody.

Thirdly, while this app allows manual album creation, your albums are stored only on your own account, and are not visible to anyone you add to your family vault. Itâd be a huge bonus to be able to share albums with your family members.

Iâd also really appreciate being able to rotate a photo right in my account, without having to download it to my device, rotate it in a separate program, and re-upload it to prime photo all over again.

David in LA,2/27/2018 23:43,"This is an excellent way to back up your iPhone photos, which will otherwise quickly eat up your 5GB cap on free iCloud storage.

I suggest setting automatic backup of pictures BUT NOT videos, as videos count against your 5 GB cap on free storage. Not so your still pictures, or even Live Photoâs! Save individual videos to Prime Photos to manage that 5GB cap.

Back up is not automatic; you have to have the Prime Photo app active on your phone, and âAuto-Saveâ enabled in settings, for the backup to take place. Again, in settings, I suggest you keep the âVideosâ switch (for auto-save) set to off.

Photos can easily be moved to an album and filtered by date; the date of a photo (say, that you download from something someone else posted) can be edited to match the date of the event.

- The option to see a specific day on different  years is removed or hidden in a way I canât seem to find it. The âMemoriesâ section is not the same. 
- Sloooooow - the speed is significantly reduced. 
- If you exit the app even for a sec it forgets the last location and you need to start all over again and of course waaaaait to load
- The Share icon is not intuitive for hiding the albums youâre sharing. That icon is usually used to actually select and share photos not view what youâre sharing.",1,False,Last update is not intuitive,,

People detection doesn't seem to be quite as accurate as Google's implementation though, so it needs a way to 'untag' those that it gets wrong, I can't see a way to do that at the moment.

A couple of drawbacks -  i) it takes an age to upload the photos, and, ii) I have an iPhone and an iPad which share photos via Appleâs Photostream so the same photos appear on both but from a couple of weeks ago, when I choose âAllâ in the App there are 2 copies of each photo - they do not seem to be identified as duplicates and there are 2 âAll Photosâ albums in the Albums folder (presumably one for the iPhone and one for the iPad) which show the same photos - confusing and using double storage.",4,False,Great app but so slow,,4555.0

oxyscythe,2016-04-03 08:20:49,"I would have used this even if the app was bad being that it's unlimited free storage, so it's a bonus that the app is excellent. Great design, features and usability.

JenJen,2016-09-30 13:57:24,"This app was perfect before the update.

Hidden photos - not sure if I can't find it or they aren't there. You can no longer hide a photo and where I had some pics in the hidden photo bit, they are now gone. As this works seamlessly with my Fire TV I don't want all my photos there for all that use it to see! 
Secondly you can no longer search by year. When you have lots of pics on there, that was a really handy feature. 
Thirdly if you don't want to auto save, there is no manual way of adding pictures. Bit disappointed with this app now.",2,False,New update isn't good,,4559.0
Durston's,2016-11-13 19:41:07,What can I say? Unlimited storage of photos for free. No more loss of phone memory (for photos at least). The app itself is really smooth with a nice user interface.

Cal Space,2017-03-25 11:33:35,"Prime must be pound for pound the best subscription service out there. Prime Photos certainly just backs up that theory: easy to use, free (for Prime users) and unlimited storage. Syncs with phone and therefore provides reassurance that your pics are housed in the cloud and available on any logged in device. Only issue that prevents 5 stars is sometimes the syncing gets a bit 'sticky' and needs a manual prompt to start so don't 100% trust it's always running in the background but otherwise it's a great app.",4,False,Another excellent component of the Prime service,,4561.0

I'm giving it a trial run for 3 months... If it doesn't improve i'll go back to competition.

Update: dropped the rating to 1 star because it's NOT uploading all photos. Since the 20th of October it didn't upload anything and it's saying ""no new photos"".

Nick18032010,2023-10-09 20:39:40,"I preferred the style of Amazon drive, as you can put stuff into files and go straight to the file and view them pictures.
I know Amazon drive is ending at the end  of the year it would be good if Amazon photos could add all the files I have my pictures in as I have hundreds in the same format with out me having to make new ones which would take me years. If they donât might have to loo at apple or google but until it ends Iâll wait. Amazon photos is good as it shows you on this day like Apple does but it needs to replicate what Amazon drive is like as this is how we reference things in years as the kids grow as we make things as we explore things if this was possible Iâd be a lot happier and Iâm sure others would be too.

Swallow Knight,2023-03-01 09:47:48,"I love Amazon photos. We have a couple of cloud storage systems for our numerous photos and videos ( google and iCloud )but Amazon is the best . 
The app is responsive , and intelligent and the search options once you have everything backed up are excellent. I have no bother finding specific places , people ( i did this online , with a VPN as europe wonât allow it ) , and things. Memories are wonderful . I also love the shuffle feature which i sometimes save as a collage. 
Keep up the good work guys. 
Only quibble is with the mobile version which is sluggish. iPad though spot on,

Went with Amazon due to it being free with Prime and the ability to do the âFamily Vaultâ. Very happy with it so far, and my father in law seems pleased with it despite being sceptical of a web solution initially. Two suggestions for Amazon: (1) on the web interface, it would be nice if the menu of navigation buttons on the left (photos, family vault, albums, etc) stayed fixed in place as you scroll down the screen, because once you have a few thousand photos it is a pain to scroll back up to the top photos every time you want to navigate and (2) I wish there was a way to manually designate/tag a person even if they are not recognised as a person by the facial recognition AI (for instance if their face is turned away).

ScrapyardGuitar,2022-08-08 07:33:30,"Storing photos on the cloud is a good way to backup your photos. I have suffered the loss of years worth of memories in the past due to hard drive failure. The basic service is free with your Amazon Prime account but only offers a small amount of storage, which is OK for a few holiday snaps per year but if you take loads of Photos then you will want to upgrade your storage limit. The one big drawback with this service is that it only stores images in chronological order. Fine for many but if you are serious about your photography then it's a bit of a drawback. If you take thousands of Photos a year then you will tend to catalog your images into folders with meaningful names such as ""Bob a Sue's wedding"" and ""day out in Bogner"" for example which makes finding photos much easier than trying to remember the month and year of a photo you took 15 years ago.

Disappointing. Update: âOn This Dayâ seems to have disappeared from the UK iPhone Amazon Photos app. Iâm baffled and quite annoyed about this. The feature was always flawed in that it didnât show all the years I had photos for, only a random selection, but it was better than nothing. âOn This Dayâ was particularly useful because I have an Echo Show 8.

BermondseyNinjaDog,2022-02-05 19:19:53,"It is crystal clear that Amazon Photos doesnât work well on the iPhone.
The app is feature poor and not really an alternative to Appleâs equally woeful Photos offering.
Despite uninstalling and reinstalling Amazon Photos several times (and other âjumping through hoopsâ tricks like clearing the cache, the editing features simply do not save. I tried more than 70 times to rotate a photo through 90 degrees. No joy. After all this effort (several hours of my life I wonât get back) the photo is still balefully looking out at me, sideways. Hopeless.
Itâs not even as if there is much richness to the app anyway. After a month of trial, it became clear that Amazon photos genuinely offers no alternative to Appleâs standard photos app anyway. Neither app provides a meaningful way to remove the multitude of informational photos we take on our phones but donât want to see on our photos timeline. Iâm probably not the only one who got Amazon Photos simply to be able to delete these off our Apple Photos film roll to use Amazon as a storage facility for these, but if you canât rotate, crop or edit then whatâs the point, eh?
No disrespect, Amazon, but you literally add nothing that isnât already there with Apple. Both companies are fairly contemptuous of customers yet neither is smart enough to recognise thereâs a demand from people willing to pay a premium to get away from the insipid basic free model.
So donât worry too much Amazon: your app is not really much worse than Appleâs with the only exception being that there app works flawlessly and yours doesnât.",1,False,Failing in iOS,,5885.0

Lydicat,2022-01-29 12:30:12,"With the big visual change in the app that has happened within the past 12 months, family vault has not been giving enough consideration and itâs showing.

I have given feedback many times over the past 3 months for them to fix, many live chats, talking to people over the phone and actual leave feedback forms in the app itself. Thereâs just no communication and I think itâs because no one knows how to fix it so theyâre sweeping it under the rug. Not a great experience btw.

Unlimited space is great sure, but when Iâm trying to select specific photos to share with the family members in my family vaultâ¦hereâs the things Iâve experienced:

-Select photos then no actual option or button to put in the vault.
-Select photos and noticed thereâs now an option in the âdownloadâ symbol (that makes no sense?!)
-Select 30 photos and select âAdd to Family Vaultâ and the app crashes.
-Select 10 photos and select âAdd to Family Vaultâ have no clue if that has worked, so have to check on my phone to see if the photos have appeared.

Shark-66,2021-05-14 08:03:48,"I got excited when I realised I could get a secondary backup of all my photos outside of Apple. Then hugely deflated when I realised that didnât include or remotely cover my videosâ¦ I pay a lot for prime and this initially seemed like it was a nice touch by Amazon but NOT including videos is a BIG miss. Either you going to backup my âphotosâ or NOT. And this doesnât really succeed. If you could include videos as unlimited then this would have been absolutely excellent. As it is itâs a half solution which basically makes it NO solution at all.

Background handling could be improved. Also the âfree up spaceâ element where once things have been backed up it can delete the photos from your iOS camera roll (but obviously you still have to get rid of them from your deleted items too).

MaybeMartyn,2020-12-25 10:09:18,"I recently discovered this app was not saving videos which is strange because we are frequently reminded that as prime members we have âunlimited storageâ, and letâs face it, you get the same with Google and Microsoft if you are members of their respective, and much cheaper, services, and they will tell you a video is only a large collection of photos anyway. 

But not to worry!  For just Â£1.49 a month I can upgrade to 100GB!  So a quick check showed I have just 22GB of videos after 5 years and who cares about Â£1.49 a month?  So obligingly I follow their instructions and upgrade. 

Only after the upgrade do I discover I no longer have unlimited storage and instead limited to 100GB, furthermore that does not include video storage. 

If it wasnât so stupid it would be funny.  I mentioned it to a colleague of mine who works with Amazon's AWS services and he merely replied âIf thereâs a way to make something complicated you can be sure Amazon will find it, unless of course they decide to go all the way and make it unusable tooâ.

No. I had the option of selecting groups of photos based on upload date, a few at a time or by date the photo was taken. A lot of clicks to remove several thousand photos that Iâd backed up.

Couple of niggles; firstly the amount of small video clips people save on their phones these days means the storage Amazon give you for video isnât enough.  Secondly, when pulling photos from various devices together this inevitably results in duplicated uploads of the same picture.  There really should be some way for the software to suggest duplicated photos and support you deleting them.  I have uploaded 85k photos and hazard a guess that 5k are duplicated - massive manual job that could be made so much simpler with some simple software tweaks.  Lastly itâs annoying that it will only upload from your phone when you have the app open - it wonât do it in the background and the night sync isnât great as it is still leaving your screen on all night (even if it shades it black).

I do really like the photo app -  I like the little memories videos that are created with photos linked by location/date - I think the app really needs a better option to get photos from Amazon photos to save back to your camera roll on your phone - Iâve found that difficult to do and had to have a convoluted workaround to get them from Amazon back in to camera roll.....

captnpyjamas,2020-05-26 13:19:18,"This app does what it sets out to do, it allows upload and viewing of images to amazon cloud storage. However there is clearly so much potential functionality not used. There are many other similar apps for handling photos, some such as picasa have been around for years, yet they have far more functionality than amazons efforts. I really hope amazon choose to build on the capabilities of this app.
Some specific gripes are lack of folder functionality, once loaded only the date taken is really a sortable criterial. No preservation of folder structures. For a few dozen photos thatâs not an issue, but if you have tens of thousands uploaded from various sources, often with date errors, it is a nightmare. In effect the app becomes a random photo server. Good luck finding that specific image from a few years ago.

Onedayapenguin,2020-05-25 12:02:01,"A fantastic app that I use to manage backups of photos from my phone & interchangeable lens camera.

My favourite things include:

- backed up RAW photos from my Sony A6xxx all show as previews, so thereâs no need to keep old photos or .jpeg copies on my pc just so I can see a thumbnail 

- unlimited use for most of the image formats I use, with an Amazon Prime membership

- creates a searchable database of people, places & objects (seems to vary depending on image format)

- I find it very easy to use

Some things I would like to further improve:

- RAW photo previews do not show in camera adjustments, so the preview & downloaded copy donât necessarily colour match (this may be dependant on camera)

- Does not seem to search RAW images for people objects

- Would love support for .insp files (360 camera images), including showing a preview of the file, and having as part of the unlimited use 

- Would love my Affinity Photo image edits to be included in the unlimited use

- There is a built in image editor but doesnât support edits to RAW files (eg it would be nice to do basic corrections and save as a .jpeg or .png etc)

- For the paid storage plan (on top of Amazon Prime membership) I would like a 200gb a year option competitive with Apples offering on iCloud, with the option to pay monthly not yearly",4,False,Great for RAW photos,,6381.0

For just under Â£8 a month I get unlimited music uploads, unlimited photo storage and unlimited primetime movies not to mention next day deliveryâs on most items I order ðð»
Most music apps like Spotify cost on average Â£10 a month and the likes of Netflix for watching movies the cheapest you can get that for is close to Â£7 a month and then theres online storage which can get expensive soon as you start going over the storage limit which isnât much due to it been free.
So roughly in total you could be spending easy Â£20+ a month for these 3 services, but with amazon prime you get all 3 of theses for a breathtaking deal of Â£8 for the lot! and with the perk of next day deliveries on amazon orders as well ðð»ð

BobbyLelat86,2015-08-08 13:43:12,"Please be aware I am a Prime member, so your experience may differ to my own.

This is by far the best photo storage app I've ever used. It uses simple tools to upload, download and share your photographs, and if you don't want to upload your entire catalogue, Amazon Photos allows you to choose specific photographs to upload. And, much to my joy, it lets you know which photographs are being uploaded at any given point - iCloud take note! The process is fast and simple, with a beautiful layout that's mirrored across iPhone, IPad and Fire TV (if you have it). 

If I had one criticism it would be the lack of an editing tool, something which is featured on Flickr and Apple Photos. Currently I have to re-download from Amazon into my library and then edit it. This is a small hindrance to me, but those more savvy than I may find it a deal breaker. 

Overall Amazon Photos is a fantastic app, and when coupled with Amazon Cloud Drive, it solves all of my storage needs.",5,False,"Simple, Intuitive, Flexible",,6821.0

Shimmyshack,2015-07-07 08:23:07,"I suppose these will be addressed in due course?:

20minute limitation on videos?! What's the difference between two 19minute and one 38 minute video - hassle.

My MP4s are often resized and aspect ratio changes

Upload is slow ~500kbps average, so unlimited means throttled-unlimited.

(Chrome) uploads full file before noticing it's already there - then stalls until you check they are the same size and allow it to skip overwrite.

(Amazon cloud drive client) can't control the path of the uploads online! So if you have multiple sources you are uploading from you cannot merge the uploads neatly.

barrymw40,2015-05-10 13:23:25,Comes as part of Amazon Prime membership. Getting unlimited storage for your photo's is therefore a great way to keep them safe. Uploading is straightforward. Could do with some improvements. Occasionally a file won't load and no error/reason is given and it doesn't say which files. Also not always stored in the order of your original file. Some basic organisational or file name edits would give it the extra star.,4,False,Excellent,,6831.0

Artic6,2014-11-17 22:23:44,"This is how Apple should've launched iCloud Photo Library  as far as I'm concerned yet its still in beta and to be honest at the moment it's completely unusable so I decided to use Cloud Drive for photos and the service, quality, integration and security of photos in this app is incredible.

Also I'd like to point out I don't work for Amazon.

Amazon Cloud Drive for photos is an amazing app it particularly helps if you have crying because you can stores many photos as you want within the Cloud Drive and it doesn't cost you anything additional videos and documents on more but you can get Â£100 gig for Â£32 a year 

You can rest assured all your photos are safe been hosted on Amazon is really stable cloud service.

Not sure why people are giving this one or two stars don't trust the ""inaccurate"" reviews try it yourself.

The only features this app is missing is metadata information from your photos is all you can really view is the file name",5,False,Totally amazing for photo professionals,,6846.0
