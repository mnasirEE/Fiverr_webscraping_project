Donottrade,1.0,Beware of trade in offer,10/9/2022,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."

jadon said ut,3.0,The Upgrades,2/4/2015,"So, yea I donâ??t like appple because I have 2 daughters and only one of my daughter phone upgrades automatically but my other daughterâ??s phones doesnâ??t.I got confused so I called apple but when I call them no one answers so I try again but no one answers so now I just upgrade my daughters phone since it can upgrade on itâ??s on. Apple please fix this issue. Also, the Apple Store now using password which is annoying because my daughters love roblox but they come to me saying,â? Dad can you put in the passwordâ?. This had got me confused because when did you have to start using a password to update a app but when I put the password in it keeps saying itâ??s wrong. Apple please fix these issues itâ??s kinda getting annoying."
KENDALL0998776126,3.0,I will be during apple,1/3/2022,Apple I done with updating my phone every 2 seconds also my phone keeps Turing on and back off it so annoying yall really need to stop scamming people for dumb items yes yâ??all have good quality but itâ??s annoying Idc if yâ??all say well you got scammed Iâ??m not gonna get scammed. Yâ??all are gonna get scammed because youâ??re not even gonna get scammed cause I am sueing  yaâ??ll these Apple products are good or whatever but Iâ??m so sick of having to update my phone every five seconds. Iâ??m sick of it turning on and off by itself these phones are lagging. I update my phone and it says it supposed to be a better update but itâ??s not. Itâ??s horrible. I literally update my phone not even a whole hour ago and itâ??s lagging. Yâ??all need to fix it fix it now.
dacappstoreus,3.0,Bad Apple service,12/6/2023,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."
BabyBree2712,4.0,Great way if you donâ??t want to come into the store,11/7/2023,I recently bought an iPhone 13 pro max and some AirPod pros I really do like the concept of just having a shop online because the Apple stores are constantly packed with people who like looking and admiring at the technology (which I donâ??t blame itâ??s nice) but Iâ??m there knowing what I want and what to buy. The scheduled courier delivery was really good as well I scheduled the night before and it came around 2pm the next day and everything was nicely packaged and boxed up safely.

But you see very little of the actual game, it is mostly ads. And not short ads.  So, sadlly Iâ??ll just keep looking till I find another one that doesnâ??t run them constantly and is smart enough to make them brief so folks can maybe  enjoy the game.  This one is hopeless, I have no ideawhy itâ??s even on here, and thatâ??s too bad because I liked it andmaybe the folks willing to pay to have ads removed handle it that way.  Iâ??m not going to do that and if I was it woukd not be to these people that should manage this game time much better.

Copahc,2.0,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,31/10/2021,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâ??s false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâ??m completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donâ??t want to see. Itâ??s ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canâ??t give it a negative review because it wonâ??t matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

And guess whatâ?¦ this multimillion dollar company has no one that is able to fix my phone! They offered to mail it off (for over $300) but no guarantee it could be fixed. If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâ??d loss everything anyway.
