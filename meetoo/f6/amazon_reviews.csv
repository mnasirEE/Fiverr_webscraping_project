Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon is awake...and watching..  To all you evil creatures, beware!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon is awake...and watching..  To all you evil creatures, beware!

If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon is awake...and watching..  To all you evil creatures, beware!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with.

I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud.

Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon is awake...and watching..  To all you evil creatures, beware!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty.

I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again.

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon is awake...and watching..  To all you evil creatures, beware!

If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon is awake...and watching..  To all you evil creatures, beware!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with.

I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud.

Do I like this ""Cloud Drive""? SHLOOP!!!! ***IMPORTANT UPDATE AT BOTTOM***",05/04/2016,"****IMPORTANT UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW***Hmm...not quite sure what to say about this ""new"" app by The Big A. Here's the thing, I am a faithful prime member, I have been for years. The free shipping and prime vids kinda makes it worth while. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I TRUST AMAZON WITH NO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO. I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon is awake...and watching..  To all you evil creatures, beware!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!

I've heard a lot about ""other"" top tier company's have security breaches. That is not going to happen to Azon.  I also try to buy products from, or through, The Big A. At least I know my package will get to me promptly, and they will go to bat for you if a third party seller does something naughty. Having said that, once upon a time I had $250 worth of music in my MP3 app...but along comes PRIME MUSIC, aaaaand it pretty much assimilated my music into this PRIME thingy and SHLOOP...my music is gone. Kinda like the BORG mother ship. ""Resistance is futile"". And then along comes THE UNDERGROUND...SHLOOP! And my phone (that was Samsung/Microsoft/ GOOGLEIZED) has an APPoplectic attack, puking out everything that has  Azon in front of it. It wasn't pretty. Apps that I loved began to get red eyes and the BORG have struck again. AND NOW, whenever I take a picture, or try to pull one up on my device without running WiFi or data on...well, you guessed it: SHLOOP! Did you know that this year (I read this, NOT MAKING IT UP) AMAZON beat out every heavy hitter in the digital, and physical world!? Yes, even more than GOOGLE,! YES, even more than APPLE! I kid you not...SHLOOP!Oh, and here's another thing: Did you know that all your pictures, even the DELETED ones are still up there in the mother ship??? EVERY picture or video you EVER took is up There!? Up There where any BORG that wants to, can see them...yes, even THOSE pictures. Remember that time when you'd had a bit to much wine and.........The Horror.........The Horror.So, do I like it....meh..I guess it's okay. Even though the The Big A's mother ship may be like a hover parent, or a bit controlling, Azon protects her acquisitions fearlessly!  Resistance is FUTILE... I gave it four stars, well, because I think my tablet is leering at me...I think my eyes are turning red.***UPDATE*** ADDED A STAR...NEED MORE STARS!  Okay, ha ha. I'm a funny guy. BUT, I've made jokes about Amazon's ""hover parenting"" style of running their business. But due to some recent events that could have been a HUGE PAIN IN MY NETHER REGIONS, Amazon SAVED those aforesaid NETHER REGIONS! I've been pretty leery. I used to get over 200 plus, spam, scam, smutty filth and aggravation. So, I considered myself pretty sceptical. But (no names...that's a no no) a certain someone tried to cheat the Big A's guidelines. Sellers are bound by these guidelines. But there are ways that if your not REALLY careful, you can still be...umm...""inconvenienced"" let's say, by someone trying to squirm their way into your wallet, and yet work within the guidelines. Well, let me say, I owe the Big A, Big time!! They have, well, SAVED MY NETHER REGIONS. And (embarrass) they've done it more than once. They have spared me GREAT embarrassments too. I used to feel a bit peeved at being watched so closely. NOT ANYMORE! THIS IS NOT SPAM! I gave over primary to Amazon. I couldn't protect my nether regions anywhere near as The Big A can. Amazon even helped me exorcise the demon that had found its way into my phone via ""sticky notices"". It got so bad that I would not sync my phone with my devices because I feared the Demon might have buddies that were looking for a couch to crash on!  I ended up flooding my phone with every Amazon App I owned. And as the Demon was being puked out of my phone the demon fought fiercely!  ""UPDATES NEEDED! YOUR ABOUT TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE, PRESS BUTTON NOW!!!"" When it was all over, I wiped pea soup out of my face and my storage was tripled. My ram had doubled. And I had control of my device again. I leave ALL of my Amazon Apps on continuously now. And oddly, my battery last longer than ever even though Amazon is awake...and watching..  To all you evil creatures, beware!

This is great!",08/01/2013,"We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!

SO EASY AND CONVENIENT",03/01/2016,"What a great way to back up your photos. I'm still working on getting my many thousands of photos uploaded/backed up, but that is only because I have so many photos stored on DVD's, CD's, thumb drives, and external hard drives and that requires literally connecting each separate storage unit to my computer and directing everything to be uploaded to the cloud. Before I was aware of this FREE benefit for Amazon Prime members I purchased an unlimited cloud storage pkg elsewhere. I am happy with that because it backs up everything on my computer, but you can't beat the ease of backing up and retrieving photos on Amazon Cloud. I love that we can set the photos to a continuous slideshow on the t.v. through our Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was a way to get all the photos I have uploaded to Shutterfly and other photo sites to the cloud because it seems that some of my only copies of certain photos are there and if they stop allowing the free storage I'm at risk of losing some very important photos. If anyone's knows how please let me know. I give this 5 stars because it has the easiest access to my photos compared to any other Cloud storage I've used. If you are an Amazon Prime member you're crazy not to utilize this safe, secure service. It rocks!
