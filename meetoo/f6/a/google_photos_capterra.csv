Verified LinkedIn User","""Why you still don't have Google Photos ?
                    ""
Overall: I love google photos
                    a lot. Easy to use, safe and secure. It is like your life summary. I like to spend time there
                    scrolling up and down wathing all my photos from different years for hours. It is like my digital
                    photo album. 
Pros: Google photos is the app I
                    love! Simply, because all my photos from years are securely stored there. Since 2016, all my life is
                    there. This is an excellent photo and video storage app, private, secure. I gather all my photos
                    there and if I need to shate them, I create a folder with specific photos and add the recipient's
                    email address, they get an email with the link, click and access to the photos shared with them.
                    Deleted files can be restored if you changed your mind and want to keep them. You get amazing
                    suggestions daily, it can be as a collage, or story with random photos selected. You see them only,
                    not shared with anyone.
                    Another great function - when you want to search for the dress in the photo for example, there is an
                    icon you press on it and it brings you the search result from Google. Image search on Google is
                    great. There was a plant I didn't know the name, I took a photo and from Google photos did an image
                    search, got the name of that plant. 
Cons: I do not like when I run
                    out of storage. This happens regularly, I do not want to pay for additional storage, instead, I use
                    different email addresses. Each new email address yoy use in Google photos offers 15 GB storage.

Reasons for Switching to
                        Google Photos: Google photos has a more dynamic interface, modern
                    outlook. Way easier to handle. iCloud is too complicated, I always see half the photos.",5,10-Oct,16-Jun-22

                    company and they just WORK!""
Overall: Every program that
                    works and intergrades without problems, fighting, and just plain works is amazing and Google is
                    Amazing for it! It requires less frustration, less time, quicker turnaround work and speeds, it
                    creates efficiency at its best!
Pros: Access, file transfer,
                    ability to view, Google just not fight with other integrations and programs they are the master!
                
Cons: In our world we always want
                    criticism. What can I do better. Keep updating, keep staying in tune with out every changing
                    electronic world, it will always change and it will alway grow and I just hope you stay in the game
                    a don't back down!
Alternatives Considered:

Reasons for Choosing
                        Google Photos: I have about 20+ different photo editing and graphic
                    programs and have used many more over the years and will continue to use whatever works for me! I
                    use them all! But Google just Works with everything and there is hands down nothing else that
                    compares to that ability and flexibility. I respect them!!",4,10-Oct,7-Sep-23

Verified LinkedIn User","""Too confusing to be worth the coolness""
                
Overall: The best thing about
                    it is that it integrates so well with your phone. That and image-recognition search. But I don't use
                    it because I don't want to be confused between my actual files and Google versions of my files.
                
Pros: Easily find photos by AI
                    recognition, date, and albums.
Cons: Confusing to maintain the
                    device vs cloud database, and some things like videos can't be downloaded.",3,10-May,9-Nov-22

"Damon
                            F.","""My review of Google Photos""
Overall: Overall, I have
                    really enjoyed using it. I tell other people to use Google programs such as Google photos when I
                    hear them talking about photo storage. 
Pros: What I like most is how
                    secure my photos are, and the fact that it sink soap with everything else that I use on the Google
                    suite. Accessibility is still very easy for me but very hard for others to get into. And I can still
                    transfer photos without too much hassle.
Cons: There’s honestly not
                    anything that I don’t like about Google Photos. I have tried several other avenues in the past to
                    back up photos and this is by far my favorite. Have not found a feature that I don’t like yet. I’m
                    not saying it’s completely perfect because there’s always room for improvement. But right now it’s
                    suits all of my needs. Now that I’m thinking about it would it be possible to sync google photos
                    with Canva?

                    stayed with that.",1,10-Oct,1-Nov-22
Safiya N.,"""Search by face""
Overall: I use Google Photos
                    to backup what I have on my phone, not everything but still tons of photos and videos. Love
                    searching by location or face, love the new magic eraser, also cinematic moments.Google Photos does
                    more with the photos/videos than Google Drive and that's why I also use it.
Pros: Look for photos according
                    to location or faces, enhance, edit, share. Memories and albums.Some storage free, still low cost
                    after. 
Cons: No more unlimited for free.
                    Such a bummer!Also I want to group photos temporarily for comparison.

Verified LinkedIn User","""Google photos is the best cloud storage for your
                    media""
Overall: My overall
                    experienced with google photos is great. I like it for it synchronized backup system i like its
                    recovery I like its editing functionality and i like it because i have upto 15 gbs of free cloud
                    storage
Pros: Google Photos is such a
                    great platform that you will like everything about it, I mean It can take backup of your media
                    files(photos and videos) automatically and there your data is very very secured. You have full
                    options of gallery so you can use google photos to view your images and videos right there and
                    delete from your device. You can recover the data if you deleted by mistakes and the best part is
                    that you can also edit your images and videos.
Cons: The thing i like the least
                    about it is that it does not have a separate storage i mean you get a free 15 GBs which is shared by
                    your whole google account like gmail drive and photos",5,10-Oct,14-Dec-23

Pros: Face Recognition Feature is
                    really good. It just requires a basic identification of the photo. After that it displays all the
                    photos of similar face in a single click.

Jonathan L.,"""J.L. Google Photos Review""
Overall: Google Photos is a
                    software that I can count on to keep my files secured and updated with the latest files I have
                    intentionally or not store any files that were on my other devices such as a smartphone, tablet or
                    desktop computer.
Pros: They categorize my photos
                    by what is seen in them. For example, if I have three photos of dogs and 4 photos of food, they will
                    conveniently create folders and store those files in them. So, when I open Google Photos the home
                    page will show me my files in the various categories. 
Cons: As someone who is currently
                    unable to get a credit card, I am unable to purchase more storage when my free 15GB are full. This
                    results in me moving to another software or creating another Google account to store my files there.",3,10-Aug,5-Jan-23

Verified LinkedIn User","""Get all your memories in one place!""
Overall: The app can handle a
                    large volume of photos without a hiccup, and you get excellent photo album services for up to 15 GB
                    without paying anything. That is more than enough for an average user. The app has simplified our
                    lives, always at our beck and call to retrieve our memories!
Pros: 1. Google Photos neatly
                    organizes all your photos, screenshots, videos, animations, etc., and lets you search them in
                    whatever way you like.
                    2. You can search for persons, places, items, docs, etc. The incredible search facility lets you
                    organize your photo collection and pinpoint a specific shot in no time.
                    3. The library keeps all your albums on the cloud. Google's Artificial Intelligence automatically
                    prepares theme-based albums for you.
                    4. The Recent Highlights feature showcases the images you clicked in the last few days. Similarly,
                    the Spotlight feature automatically takes a person's best picks and creates a collage.
                    5. It can automatically spot similar shots giving you the flexibility to keep any or all of them.
                    6. You can share your albums with your near and dear ones or everyone.
                    7. The feature of sharing your photos with your partner by adding a partner account is fantastic.
                    The moment your partner clicks a picture, you can see the snap instantly from the cloud storage.
                    8. Every email account gets 15GB of free storage. If you ever feel that space is insufficient, you
                    can always buy more storage space at nominal rates.
                    9. Google Photos sends stylized photos and animations; more often than not, they are excellent.
                    10. It is also possible to alter the quality of the photo backup – ranging from original to medium.
                    The cloud backup ensures that your photos are safe, even if you lose your device.
                
Cons: 1. Free storage of 15 GB is
                    not enough and gets filled up pretty fast when you allow backup of videos or insist on original
                    quality. If your storage gets exhausted, you lose proper access to all Google services that are
                    storage based. Your emails will not come in the inbox, which is very awkward.
                    2. You require excellent Wi-Fi and mobile internet to reap the full potential of this app;
                    otherwise, most of your photos will not be backed up, or you may not access your snaps when needed.
                    3. The face recognition feature is not perfect, and you need to train the app to confirm that the
                    faces are of different persons.

Overall: This is a great cloud
                    photo app that works very well on mobile. I don't have to be concerned about running out of storage
                    space on my phone. Even if I erase photographs from my phone to save up space, they are all backed
                    up and protected.
Pros: I love how the Google
                    Photos algorithm works very well to detect faces and use this feature to keep shared albums updated
                    automatically. The heat map with photo locations is also amazing. All the metadata is well preserved
                    in the file so it works fine while searching and finding older photos. It also allows you to change
                    the dates and hours of your images if necessary. The mobile app is also great in saving memory by
                    making quickly uploading and detecting of backup files.
Cons: I am very sad the free
                    storage of high-quality photos is gone though the paid plan isn't prohibitively costly for the
                    average user. It also could have improved photo edit tools

Overall: My overall experience
                    with the software was great as I use it on daily basis. Most of the time I need to access old photos
                    for editing and designing purposes and Google Photos helps me to store and access them on tip of my
                    fingers. This is great software and will definitely help users looking for good and secured cloud
                    storage.
Pros: The platform is great as it
                    has a storage of 15 GB for storing your data or photos. Which helps you to secure a large amount of
                    data on it. You can access all of your already backed-up photos from anywhere and anytime this is
                    the best part of Google Photos. It also helps to find photos by different types of search tools and
                    options. One of the best apps with a good interface and smooth user experience.
Cons: Although the software is
                    great and very useful but there is something which can be improved like the software will only let
                    you access the photos if there is an Internet Connection. The storage can also be increased as
                    sometimes even 15 GB is not enough for storing all your data. There should be some more editing
                    tools other than the basic ones.

                    everyone as Google is the most trusted platform and will provide you the best service with the best
                    security system. Just go for it guys you don't need to use this software also just keep the
                    automatic backup on and everything will be done by the software for you.
Pros: The app is free of cost and
                    this is the best thing about the app it has a storage of 15 GB approximately which is capable of
                    storing lots of data. You can just switch on the automatic backup option in the app and your all
                    photos and videos will get back up by themselves. You can access them back again whenever you want
                    to. Nothing can be better then this.
Cons: Everything is great but I
                    think the storage capacity should be improved by Google. As for a photogenic guy who clicks photos
                    every day it doesn't take much time to get your storage full. The app fully works on the Internet
                    connection and it will not work offline this is something which Google need to work on making it
                    compatible when a device is offline too.

Overall: Overall, Google
                    Photos is very useful and helpful for me. I use this software for storing my pictures and videos,
                    for freeing up space from my phone's storage, for sharing the data with my family members and I save
                    the stories which Google Photos automatically made from the past memories.
Pros: Every feature of Google
                    Photos is impactful. I mostly like the stories which Google Photos automatically make for us to give
                    a reminder of our past memories, i oftenly save these stories. I like the 'free up space' feature.
                    It helps to free up our phone's storage. The editing tools given are quite impressive because some
                    of its editing tools are not given in even other editing applications, specially the video
                    stabilising tool is very useful for me, it stables the shakiness of the video. It's a nice an
                    amazing software, i love it.
Cons: Everything in this software
                    is perfect except the given storage space, in my point of view. There must be given more storage
                    space or the storage buying price should be reduced, it's quite high. So that we can use this

Overall: Sin duda el mejor
                    sofware para gestion de fotos y videos.
Pros: Por la facilidad de
                    realizar backups de tus fotos y videos automáticamente. Y lo mejor que tiene es el borrado de los
                    archivos que tengamos resguardados, una solución practica con un solo clic, de esa forma ahorras
                    espacio en tu celular o dispositivo y no pierdes nada. Luego en la versión paga es muy bueno para
                    retocar las imágenes. La facilidad de buscar por una palabra imágenes y la agrupación automática por
                    detección de rostros es genial, si quieres encontrar las fotos de algún conocido solo lo tienes que
                    seleccionar y te encontrará en todas las fotos que haya aparecido, genial, ningun otro servicio vi
                    que funciona similar.
Cons: Dejó de ser ilimitado en su
                    version gratuita, y aunque ofrece una version paga no convence el precio ya que acostumbró a una
                    generación con su version gratuita. 
Reasons for Choosing
                        Google Photos: Por la rapidez en la busqueda por rostros y/o objetos. Si quieres buscar
                    un auto solo pones en buscar auto y te mostrará los resultados de las fotos que tengan un automovil

Overall: Google Photos has
                    been a critical tool in the advance of my business.I can share files that are needed by the team in
                    a very short time.
                    Also, I do not have to worry about my photos getting lost as they are automatically backed up and
                    the software ensures the total safety of my files.
Pros: I liked the Automatic
                    Backup Feature most as I do not have to worry about my photos and videos getting lost.
                    Apart from that,Google Photos is appealing as it is secure and I can access my files from multiple
                    devices,which is totally awesome.
Cons: The free storage space can
                    be increased a little bit from 15GB to enable users to utilize Google Photos a lot more.
Reasons for Switching to
                        Google Photos: The software I was using previously before shifting to Google Photos
                    does not have a lot of functionality as compared to Google Photos. Google Photos has eased my life a

Overall: It is easy to use. I

                    saleable stock images.
Pros: It is easy to use if all
                    you want to do is take and share low- to medium- quality photos. It automatically backs up
                    everything, so you can find it immediately on your other devices. the photo editor is easy to use
                    and has good custom filters, cropping and rotation to apply quick fixes.
Cons: Unfortunately, when you
                    start working with big photos it becomes a problem. It would be nice if it did not automatically
                    backup those, since I was planning to store them somewhere else anyway. Any edits revert the photo
                    to the lower quality small size, so the photo editor becomes useless. It is difficult to go back a
                    few years and delete photos that you no longer need, and you will exceed your storage quota.",3,10-Jul,26-Aug-22
Alessio T.,"""Strongly recommend""
Pros: For a free tool it's

                    even half of the space. A valuable ally for sharing albums and photos with others. The photos are
                    loaded with a compression that does not compromise the general quality, this implies a lot of space
                    saved: for me it is exceptional.
Cons: I haven't found any defects
                    in general, except that the automatic synchronization is not always perfect, it waits for me to

Cons: I don't like how my storage
                    is limited unless I pay for extra storage",3,10-Jun,20-Nov-22

                    para descubrir como te puedes bajar fotos""
Overall: Suy un usuario
                    privado. Realmente, no me resuelve más problema que el de la capacidad de almacenamiento de mi PC
                
Pros: Organización de las fotos.
                    Este es un ejemplo de que no me dan libertad para escribir lo que quera.
Cons: Si quieres tener copia de
                    las fotos en tu ordenador, es complicadísimo. Cuando consigues descargártelas, de dan un formato zip
                    que no se puede leer por el programa wil zip que me bajé de la web.
Reasons for Choosing
                        Google Photos: Parecía que ofrecía facilidades, pero luego no es así.",3,10-Apr,20-Dec-22
