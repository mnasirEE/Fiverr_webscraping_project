Joe Piepszowski,"Awful app. Amazon has decided that users are incapable of organizing, sorting, or ordering
            their own photos. The most basic function of sorting by name does not exist. Want to backup a folder from
            your PC and view it here? Nope, it all just gets put in with everything else, not even put into its own
            Album. Want to put photos into an album? Hope it's only a couple, because you have to click each photo one
            by one, no batch selecting. I'd list more, but reviews are limited to only 500 characters.",2,"May 11, 2024"
A Google user,"Works well auto uploading photos from phone. Love that I can store uncompressed, even raw,
            pics. Downgraded to 3 stars due to lack of some basic features. When adding pics to folders you can't
            arrange folders alphabetically so you have to look until you find it. Pics won't auto rotate when you rotate
            your device. Basic info isn't readily available (location, what folder it is in, etc). No option to delete
            pics from your device when deleted from this app. Just not well thought out.",3,"May 8, 2024"
Danny,"Amazon Photos' primary benefit is its free unlimited photo storage for Prime members. The
            application/interface as a whole is OK, but there are some areas for improvement. -1 star for not
            automatically sorting images into the album names they were uploaded from. -1 star for taking away the
            feature that allowed users to delete photos from the cloud and local storage simultaneously. Please, please
            bring it back.",3,"May 15, 2024"
Katie Skellenger,"App is clunky and second-rate compared to other similar apps. I can't believe the lack of
            features. Also seems like a scam bc there is no way to delete all photos at once.*** So it cons you into
            paying for photo storage. Cause who wants to individually select hundreds of photos. *** I figured it out.
            You select and then drag/ scroll down through all the photos to select all. Then you can delete multiples or
            all photos.",1,"May 8, 2024"
Rob Oliver,"Unlimited free storage for prime member is great, automatic backup is nice. The app is
            another story. It has zero features for managing/organizing photos. Only download, add to album, edit,
            delete. The desktop web interface at least let's you create folders; and even has the ability to upload
            folders from a PC. But there is no access to folders in the app. No way to relocate, rename, or even
            navigate. This app simply lacks virtually all the features I need from it.",2,"April 22, 2024"
Emmalee Jantzi,"Love the unlimited photo storage for prime members! Unfortunately, it does not include video
            storage, which isn't a huge deal since I move all my videos to an external hard drive anyway. But, the
            constant push notification on the app about my videos not being able to be backed up is really annoying. I
            swipe it away and then it reappears again quickly. Ugh.",5,"April 26, 2024"
susan ross,"I'm changing my review. I did discover how to edit photos again when the app was changed.
            Very nice. Now, I recently discovered the app has been once again 'updated' once again. Updating is not
            always a good thing. Why can't you leave it alone? It is not as easy to order prints now with these changes.
            My goal is still to empty my app of all photos because I do not want to depend on it...it's not dependable.

Tori Sereika,"The app is very basic and not very user friendly. I wish that it would automatically sort
            photos into the same albums that they were imported from. I also wish that the home screen filtered out
            photos/videos that have already been added to albums. I'm trying to sort them into albums to organize it,
            but from the home screen, all I can see is everything - there is no way of telling which ones have already
            been moved to an album. It just feels very disorganized.",1,"March 28, 2024"
Tammy Krout,"Settings don't matter, app does what it wants. Tell it to ignore specific folders, it
            uploads anyway. Tell it not to upload videos, it tries to anyway. Don't bother turning off notifications, it
            will spam your phone with super random messages. Often about video limits being reached when you've told it
            to ignore videos. I've deleted the albums it was supposed to ignore multiple times and they always come
            back. Save yourself time and a lot of headaches. Avoid",1,"May 1, 2024"
Kara Bucher,"When I recently discovered that a flash drive, which had all my children's photos on it
            since the day they were born, was corrupted and I could no longer use it, I was relieved to find out that
            Amazon Photos uploads everything in the background. Now, my photos are safe, and I can finally print them
            all while still having secure digital copies.",5,"May 11, 2024"
IA MERROR (1AMERR0R),"Unusable. Constant app crashes and upload issues. It took forever to upload my photos and
            many of them show up black. You are better off uploading on a PC. Photos are also way to expensive on
            Amazon. Walmart offers a much better deal than this. However, this still works as a way to backup your
            photos. The app just needs some love.",1,"April 22, 2024"
Benjamin Larson,"For the lack of better words. F$-!ing life saver this app is if you take a ton of photos.
            They actually took me recommendation and added a button to turn off backing up videos so it's usable for me
            now. Just delete some of your vids of your space and clear the trash if its at max first, though; Otherwise
            you'll have trouble. Thanks Amazon for unlimited photo original quality+ raw backups!! I'm only scr3^,^ed on

Diana Everett,"I realize, just like all of the picture apps, it's a ploy to squeeze more money out of
            people, by pulling them in with free storage space, but I barely used it and know the space has run out.
            Just like Prime, to entice you with extras to join, but only offer the free junk movies, music, etc. and
            even though you offer all these incentives for the Prime experience, you don't realize that what you're
            getting is half assed until you hook us in. So, no. I don't utilize your Photos App. because I have",3,"April 5, 2024"
Barbara N,"Never loose a photo. And as long as you're a prime member you have more saving space. Love
            the features; can search by date or photo and you use to be able to fix lighting on pictures taken in low
            light. Haven't seen light fix in a minute. But, still I can say nothing bad about Amazon Photos! UPDATE:2024
            STILL GOING STRONG! I LOVE MY AMAZON PRIME!!",5,"March 21, 2024"
Thomas Schmitt,"The fact that you cannot easily multi-select photos like you can in Apl or Ggl photo apps is
            a major, major shortcoming that really angers me. The app seems designed to specifically make it hard for
            users to mass delete photos, I assume because Amazon wants the data in those pictures for as long as
            possible. Therefore, they make it very difficult to perform mass deletion by making mass selection hard.

Pikey Berbil,"Not viable alternative to Google photos unfortunately. Amazon photos is not easy to navigate
            or understand set up because app is slow , clunky, and freezes . Unresponsive selection & button
            pressing , so unable to set up albums or face recognition. I was hoping to have gallery organization that
            removes photos or marks photo that i have sorted. hate going through thousands of photos not knowing what
            was already sorted or not sorted. With Amazon Photos even scrolling is slower that drying paint.",1,"April 9, 2024"
Chelsea Niemann-Anschutz,"Going downhill fast. Contacted them many times trying to fix issues with tagging errors. All
            my kids are auto tagged as the same kid, and was told to individually manually fix 1000s of photos. They
            still advertise free photo print delivery but it's actually $3.50 shipping now. No more ordering prints from
            the app, but instead get redirected to a basic website with an awful cropping feature, using a 3rd party
            company. Transfering uploads will be awful, but hate that memories are committed here.",1,"April 21, 2024"
Craig Seman,"Best Way to Save Photos and Videos. Everyone has an Amazon prime account, this app gives you
            free photo storage with one. That's incredible. I decided to pay for the video storage and it's all so
            seamless and easy. You can share very quickly and I have had no issues. It's also nice to pull up the pics
            on the computer so fast and easy.",5,"April 10, 2024"
Clinton Wheeler,"Unlimited storage as a perk! Awesome! I think this app will improve over time and include
            more features and little tweaks based on user feedback and so far I like it and use it. So far this app has
            no downside. I wish I could pay to host my videos and then I wouldn't need any other subscriptions!!! Are

Princess XXXNoneya,"Amazon Photos would be great but my prime benefits somehow was having issues with someone
            hacking me and when I stopped having prime apparently my Amazon photos were all deleted. Before everything
            would synch with previous emails I'd have so I figured my photos which I saved on there would be there. -one
            good thing is Amazon Photos uploads and saves all photos and doesn't delete to save space",1,"April 28, 2024"
Sudip Hore,"Good, but lots of opportunity to improve. Would really like some more sorting options in
            albums, for example to sort by latest first, otherwise, have to scroll all the way down. Also, Google like
            lens feature would be really helpful, otherwise, often I am still relying on Google photos for photos I
            take. Still missing some of these features. Also, using Google lens like feature to identify birds would be
            very helpful.",4,"February 21, 2024"
Kyle Hoen,"App works well to upload photos from phone, but after that, is not helpful. I have 50+
            albums that can't be sorted by name and appear in random order with names partially hidden. So it is time
            consuming, if not useless, to show photos to other people. Text search feature needs to use deep search;
            otherwise you have to know the first name of the album. The tools to edit albums and other cleanup is also
            very limited. Much better to do on the computer.",2,"December 18, 2023"
Mark Simmons,"This app does what it wants. Set it to upload whatever folders you choose but the minute you
            go back to your photos, it unchecks the folders you checked. It will do this over and over. I can go to my
            desktop where I have to download photos from Google to the computer, then upload them to Amazon. Many extra
            steps and as a bonus, it turns them sideways so I have to edit them one at a time to turn them back to
            normal. This app just randomly chooses what it will upload and there is no way to fix it.",1,"January 20, 2024"

            while holding down your finger(and the screen scrolls)..... like competitors. It does have some photo
            editing features built in. I like the upload capabilities. Overall, a good app, but when you need certain
            features it can be a pain to use.",3,"February 5, 2024"
Randal ‚ÄúRandy‚Äù Hoover,"Pros (5 stars): It's great if you need a place to store photos. Unlimited photo storage.
            Cons (0 stars): Searching for a photo is about as easy and helpful as dumping a shoebox full of loose photos
            on the floor and searching one by one for the photo you're looking for. Despite setting the app to
            automatically upload photos, it rarely happens unless I open the app to double check. Unlimited photo
            storage for Prime members only. No longer offers unlimited video storage to Prime members.",2,"January 3, 2024"

            app. can only delete the photos one at a time. even after I eventually deleted them all, they're still on
            the server for 90 days even though I don't want them there. I am actually paying money to use Google One

Thomas Featsent,"It's fantastic. I'm hoping they continue to make it better. It makes you feel good about
            being a prime member and having these benefits. It has its positives and negatives. Nothing that probably
            won't get better with time. Currently, my Amazon drive is locked, and they can't seem to unlock it after
            multiple attempts. Been five months that it's been locked. It's terrible we don't have access to our photos.

            There is no way to organize your photos. Imagine you uploaded few hundreds or thousands of photos and
            managed to create some albums. There is no folder structure, there is no albums inside albums, there is no
            tags. If you ever need to get your photos back - you will be able to get a huge pile in one folder. Good

            well organized. Dates, albums, and video making are pluses. Best photo app!! Google photos is so childishly
            jealous!! They make every effort to prevent us from using Amazon photos. Google's behavior only makes us

            have it printed, and every time it saves it disappears. or it goes somewhere unknown that I can't find,

            Android photo folder management usage or syncs is non-existent. For a techie like me, even navigating this

Michael Jackson,"Amazon Photos Saved My Life (the many parts that were captured in various snapshots)! The
            automatic folders created helps to keep organizing easy, plus if you need to create additional folders, then
            the world is your oyster. My ultimate fav is ordering dynamic prints of your photos. Familiar w/Google
            Photos? You'll recognize options like different canvas sizes, metal prints, etc. This beats Google Photos bc
            u can print onto clear glass-like acrylic, which is sturdy & aesthetic pleasing.",5,"January 26, 2024"
Jamie McClanahan,"Almost all photos are present and accounted for. However, there is almost no instruction on
            how to use the app and downloading the photos onto a device you are using has again. No instruction and is
            painfully cumbersome. But the quality of picturs is great and I appreciate having it included in my
            subscription",3,"January 5, 2024"
Valerie Lamson,"Updated review from 5 stars to 1. I'd give it a negative 10 if I could. Be careful as their
            3rd party services can copyright your own photos. I deleted the app because of this. They're my photos and
            no one but myself can copyright them. I deleted the app immediately after I read that. Also there's no trash
            can to make sure your photos are deleted and it's not an easy app to use. You're better off using Google
            drive. It's free and much easier to use!!!!!",1,"April 24, 2024"
Steven Kielkucki,"This app only presents historic photos in portrait mode and is unable to adjust to
            landscape. So anytime you take a picture and you try to turn it to its proper format, it fails and returns
            you to a starting point. I'm certain that others have mentioned this over the last two years, but Amazon
            (and Mr. Bezos) don't care because they (he) have (has) locked you in and still gain income and personal
            info from the photos.",2,"November 25, 2023"
Charles Parent,"Amazon photo gives me peace of mind knowing that my photos are backed up. Not on my device
            which can be lost or a hard drive in my house which could be damaged and is vulnerable to fire. It's an
            insurance policy for my memories. My one complaint is the app keeps nagging me to backup folders that I do
            not want backed up such as GIPHY and Bitmoji even though these folders are not selected. Yes, if a new
            folder is discovered, please notify me. Don't notify me if it has been ignored before.",4,"November 24, 2023"
Zach Garner,"This app is an afterthought of an afterthought. Picture selection is a pain using the
            ridiculous tiny thumbnails. Mass deleting junk photos is a pain. Navigating the weird interface is a pain.
            And the one place I thought this would shine is digital picture frame integration, but no. Aside from
            backing every photo I ever take (that's a lot of junk I don't want) this app is just a pain to use and
            misses every opportunity to be useful by instead just being another dumb backup application.",2,"April 14, 2024"
Jos√© Fi√∫za,"Great for saving images, perhaps mainly because it's got no space limit. A few features are

            without a glitch. Will revise my review upon further improvements, if any. EDIT: Not all photos are

Lorne Higginson,"I'm knocking 2 stars off due to Frustrating user interface issues. The older version of the
            app was actually better. Uploads are turned off but I kept getting upload paused notifications. I had to
            turn all notifications off as it wasn't clear any notification setting was working. Functions are
            confusingly spread across buttons and a button drawer. When you pull the drawer up the buttons disappear.

            backup? Well that brings me to this app's biggest flaw: when performing a backup, my entire home network's
            bandwidth is used and nobody can use the Internet until it is done, which takes a ridiculous amount of time

Benjamin Snow,"Navigating the app and trying to sync photos to your fire stick can be a bit ambiguous. It
            hasn't been as easy as just selecting photos that you want to appear on your television. It tends to take

Michael Holmes,"Until the recent update, I had this app rated at 5 stars. It retains most of the features of
            the old version and the new interface looks clean, modern and is easy to navigate once you've had a play
            about with it for a few minutes. Throw in unlimited photo storage for Prime members, it's pretty awesome.
            However, it only gets 3 stars now, as photos no longer rotate when I turn my phone meaning that a photo
            taken in landscape mode has to be viewed in portrait mode. Why? Please fix this.",3,"November 11, 2022"
A Google user,"12/16/18: Unlimited photo storage for Prime members is wonderful. Overall, a great app, but
            as soon as I paid for extra storage for my videos they keep reuploading constantly, even the folders that I
            chose not to auto save. Update 12/10/19: At least once a month my Auto Save folders setting resets and the
            app starts reuploading everything again. No duplicates recognition whatsoever, and no way to cancel the
            reuploading unless I don't want to auto save the folder.",2,"December 10, 2019"
Anthony Mu√±oz,"I really love that with prime you get unlimited photo storage for original photo sizes. As a
            photographer, that is honestly a huge deal, but the only thing I would have some feedback on is the
            interface. Navigating the photos is easy enough, but for someone like me where I need to organise all of my
            photo shoots, I find it to be more complicated then I'd like. If they could just make organizing photos much
            more simple and creating folders as well, it would be perfect.",4,"February 3, 2022"

            App just backed your photos up to the cloud but it has left me without so many memories. I'm gutted. In

            add custom tags, so the tag feature is useless for any photos that aren't of people. Amazon Photos has some

            the past photos, great feature. But my phone can not handle that punishment on the cache. I'll have to
            uninstall again soon, currently I ahve to clear the cache daily on the app just so my phone continues to

            the same date so lovely for little reminders of special occasions and holidays etc. You can create albums
            for sorting photos and the Face recognition is really clever too (if not a bit scary how well it works). üò≥

            again. I've had to remove permissions for the app to access my photos as it was still automatically
            uploading even with the feature was turned off. It was even telling me to turn on auto-upload.",1,"January 19, 2023"
Matthew Crighton,"1) Regularly get occasions where the app tells me that photos are being uploaded but there's
            no progress bar and changing / disconnecting / reconnecting internet does nothing. Often requires device

            3) No ability to cancel the upload once it's started, at least not that I could see. Not a good experience.

            improved: 1. Option to exclude my phones camera roll (mixing it with my camera photos uploaded). 2. Option
            to sort so photos don't always have to be viewed in reverse - eg. Oldest to Newest etc (by filename too if
            possible) 3. Settings option not to include the blurb every time the photo is shared - this is annoying to
            remove the text every time. Thanks.",3,"July 12, 2019"
Liam D,"Still has plenty of bugs when compared to Google Photos - uploads are clunkier, and when the
            app is running in the background it seems to lose track of what it was doing. If you keep checking in on the
            app it eventually gets there. If you were paranoid about it going wrong then the desktop app may be the
            better option. Unlimited photo storage (for now) is a huge bonus and I'll continue to use the app for that

            photos are uploaded to the 'cloud', others aren't. Why? Most annoyingly, the option to download certain
            photos is removed, seemingly at random. WHHHHYYYY?!",2,"December 16, 2018"

            anymore, the navigation feels confusing, and the feature to edit photos is gone now. Amazon photos used to
            be a good ish comparison to Google photos but now the android app has just dropped so bad. The only saving

            been quickly done). The lack of this being a gallery means 2 apps for one process, the UI should be ""out of

Tiberiu Gherasim,"Keeps full quality of images but photo sharing and browsing is primitive compared to Google
            and the new update made it even worse. You can have only one shared folder and within that folder you can't
            jump to specific time or date. If you have 50k photos you have to scroll down for ages if you want to see
            older photos. This update is so bad it makes me want to move to another platform.",2,"December 20, 2022"

Findlaigh Shawe,"If Amazon Photos was a human being it would be that partner we've all known; congenial,
            gifted, charming and utterly unreliable. Promises are made but never kept, errands are ignored, there's a
            lot of napping or stoned lethargy...but the sex is great. This app's version of great sex is its file and
            folder management but uploads and downloads just don't happen - no error messages, just empty promises and
            invisible files.",3,"June 9, 2020"
Jan-Christian Zaluski,"The most un-user friendly app ever. You can't even access your albums from the home page,

            replicate album structure set up offline and won't connect to other photo apps which you can do things like
            a collage. Editing awful., it just bundles all images together. Only using it now as a backup store as free

            regularly glitch on my S8 (uploading infinite time despite pics already being uploaded) and always hassles

            your entire photo and video library. You can not delete anything from the app without it deleting from your
            phone. It's also ridiculously unorganized, you can only sort by the date it was loaded not by folder. I just
            wanted to upload 1 specific folder of Disney pics but they were all loaded a different times over the past 7
            yrs so I have to go and click all of them through the last 7 yrs. No thanks! Stupid.",1,"April 11, 2020"

Christian B.,"Sorting, albums, search are all far behind of anything current organizing and storage
            applications would provide. If I click into an album, it opens an entry album, saying there is nothing in
            there. Sorting allows by attributes such as ""date uploaded"" and ""date taken"", which is more than Amazon
            Drive offers, but that's a whole different (worse) level of insufficient. No extra features. Family Vault is
            not explained properly, I wonder how usage count of that is.",1,"August 10, 2021"
Guilherme Taffarel Bergamin,"Amazon Prime clients do not have unlimited storage in my country for some weird reason.
            Doesn't even have a way to access your trash items to permanently delete them, so I can't even make some
            space for the photos I need backed up. Everybody should move to Yandex Disk. It is free and has unlimited
            photos backup with the trade off of ads, which is fair. Get rid of all your Amazon products. They are a

Reinhold Behringer,"This app works very reliably. Good options to control the sync and upload. I only use it to
            automatically upload pictures from my mobile to Amazon Photos. For managing pictures on my Amazon Photos
            account I prefer to use the web. So I do not need any photo management or editing features on this app. I
            prefer the app lean and fast for auto-sync and upload, and so far the app does that well.",5,"February 6, 2021"
HarkHysteria,"Awesome so far... Just want there to be a place you go as soon as you open the app to see
            all photos that are ""on"" the cloud (already uploaded to internet) only and remember that setting. It is nice
            to know which ones from my phone are not yet clouded but that could be separate by default or user
            preference. ---------+One thing that is annoying is that even though I already reviewed it on here it keeps

Nicholas,"The app is just not great. The interface is confusing, with all photos from the device shown
            and you can't seem to remove entire folders like ""whatsapp images"" from this view. I have many folders of
            junk that I never want to store on a cloud service - how do I get rid of these from the app? The app also
            does not support a two-way sync, so I now have to delete the same photos in two places.",2,"February 11, 2021"
A Google user,"***update 03/11/18 No longer recieving Photos of the day notifications even though turned

            smart album good but will only work against lowest level directory, no use if nested sub directories of

Jane McCarthy,"Absolutely awful. If it wasn't for trying to make a screensaver for my firestick I wouldn't

            for 3 photos!) If you then want to add them to an already existing album it is not intuitive and lots of
            clicking around the app. Absolutely awful",1,"June 28, 2020"

            I've tried to sort these out it hasn't worked. I'm sure there will be a way. I did test an idea on a photo I

            create an album when you upload an album. You can't select all from an album. There's a giant ""memories""

            many clicks - ability to view albums as grid or list. Reduce scrolling if there's many albums Pros: - albums

Jack Adrian Zappa,"This app has no network control. It will attempt to use a large portion of network pipe
            without regard for anyone else on it, resulting in intermittent network access by everyone on the network. I
            understand that you want to get the initial download done ASAP, but you shouldn't do that without thought to
            the User eXperience. I had to disable it's access to WIFI as I couldn't find ANY pause button, and then I'd
            forget to turn WIFI back on when I'd not be needing the network. This should have very low network priority.
            Also, when I don't care if it uses my network, it would inexplicably pause, making it actually never
            complete. Had to have it run in the foreground with talkback on to allow me to track its progress audibly
            while not using the network to try and keep it downloading. VERY poor UX. If I could give it 0 stars or
            less, I would.",1,"December 27, 2021"
K Williams,"Excellent and safe way to look after and store my photography collection. I really like that
            the app creates gentle memory joggers in the form of random auto selected images then notifies you to view

            began at age 20 and has continued for over 46 years so my collection is fairly vast. I'm fussy about quality

            photos as previously mentioned, free delivery, movies and other shows also if you have Amazon fire tablets,

            search for any particular day. And the Album functionality isn't complete: why can't you sort albums

            clear/delete duplicate photos easier and for some reason aesthetically Amazon software is always
            underwhelming. (Just not pretty :) super happy it's an option though so if you need something and have prime

            what images are shared with others. ITS EASY, EASY, EASY! All part of Amazon Prime at a small monthly fee of
            around two Starbucks coffees. You should really check out Amazon Prime; free videos, free books, free

David Hinkemeyer,"Do NOT use this product. Amazon refuses to provide any means to restore all of your photos
            or back them up to your own drive. The only means to back them up is to click on each image individually,
            with a max selection of 1000 photos. This is absolutely absurd, and is the antithesis of a backup service.
            Furthermore, they are intentionally doing it to promote their other services and keep you using their
            service to acquire subscription fees. They are blocking you from your own data.",1,"April 8, 2021"

            other stuff I can't recall. Unlimited photo storage may be the best give-away from ANY company. You may not

Amy Lopez,"If you have Prime or download this app...it will automatically download EVERY photo saved to
            your device. It will do so without notifying you and you will then have to go into the browser or app and

            if not you will delete the photos not only from your amazon photo or amazon cloud but WILL DELETE ALL FROM
            YOUR PHONE!!!!!!! Super sketchy invasion of privacy in my opinion...as I was never made aware by signing up
            for prime I would automatically be enrolled in this as well....so now that i have been talking to SEVERAL
            different amazon customer service reps I myself figured out how to delete from Amazon cloud and opt out of
            this so that my photos arent uploaded in the future.....and are also not deleted from my device. Oh btw you

            uninstall it. Before it uploaded family photos I didn't want uploaded. Yikes! This app is far behind any

Erica Campbell,"Good feature included with prime for unlimited photo storage, I use it as a second back up.
            Downside is that it uploads every photo and if you delete a photo it doesn't delete on amazon photos and
            also if you have your photos sorted into albums, amazon photos doesn't pick this up. If you have prime

            with many Amazon representatives. They refused me any access to my photos, due to a ""failure to comply"" with
            their terms of usage. They WILL NOT tell you, in any way, what terms were violated! READ THAT AGAIN. They
            have the right to delete all of your photos with absolutely NO explanation to you.",1,"July 6, 2022"
M Khan,"Very easy and efficient to use. Uploads photos from device very quickly and automatically.
            Only thing I don't like is telling it not to upload certain photos from certain apps which it doesn't always
            follow so I have to go into Amazon Photos and delete what I don't want to be there",4,"April 11, 2021"
A Google user,"I had to uninstall this app. I was excited to get it as I've run out of memory and VZ keeps
            asking me to buy more. But this app keeps trying to upload my pics but seems to start over every day! It
            would get so far and then say loaded 0! And it used up my battery like crazy! My phone never goes dead in a
            day, but with this uploading every day, my phone was practically dead in a couple hours! I finally have up!

Lace Queen (Lotus),"I haven't really played around with this app. I DO LOVE the backup/storage, but I can't get

            stay neutral at this point and say three stars, but mostly a five star from what I've figured out etc. Still

Justin Young,"They modified the app and now only photos you have uploaded appear in the feed. To see in

A Google user,"Perfect except for one issue. Unlimited original res. photos for prime members is what
            separates this service from it's competitors (Google Photos). However, limited video backup prevents this
            from being used exclusively. Google allows unlimited backup of high res videos rather than simply capping

            albums. Plus it's been showing the same 5 photos for a week. When it is going to rotate. I have put a bunch
            of other photos. I gave it 2 stars cause I guess it is showing some pictures.",2,"August 4, 2021"
A Google user,"overall easy to use, upload times are longer than Google for whatever reason. My biggest
            issue is that there is no way to filter uploaded from not uploaded photos. I have to dig through hundreds of
            photos looking for one that has a small, hard to see cloud at the bottom of it to know if I've missed

Ailyn Varela,"DO NOT USE. I downloaded this app to store my pictures and as it started the syncing process
            it started deleting photos from my phone. When I noticed it was doing this i stopped the upload and it still
            somehow deleted all my photos from my phone and only some uploaded to the app. The photos are nowhere to be
            found. I even downloaded disk digger and since the photos weren't physically deleted they're nowhere to be

Edward Jimenez,"I really like the app, but I cannot rate it higher than 3-stars because the servers
            sometimes are unreachable. Also, when an upload fails, it appears to restart from the beginning instead of

            working, is the same day I noticed all my pics, screenshots, EVERYTHING is gone. I am so upset. And,

            downloading like crazy. I quickly deleted the app off of my fire stick and uninstalled when I realized that

            move them from the main photos list. You have to keep scrolling back through all of your pics to get back to

            have no idea what is or isn't already on the app. Granted, before the update, if you selected a photo that
            was already uploaded, it would take away the upload icon, and it was a bit of a pain to try to figure out
            which one was preventing you from uploading the rest. I wish that you could choose photos and the app upload
