Jay Bee,"Corruption at Nevada VA hospitals! I believe that justin is using Burp Suit, Frida, ADB Shell, Javascript, google Firebase, and/or AndroGoat for stalking, harassment, identity theft, and cyber crimes. I viewed some information about SSL/TLS Bypass and I am experincing the same problems. VR&E is supposed to help disabled veterans get training to obtain suitable employment.

Ted B,Been using Amazon photos for years was working very well. But today I tried signing in and it keeps saying something went wrong. After talking to customer service rep found out my account had been locked due to unauthorized attempted log in. After talking to five different Representatives over two days.

Joe Piepszowski,"Awful app. Amazon has decided that users are incapable of organizing, sorting, or ordering their own photos. The most basic function of sorting by name does not exist. Want to backup a folder from your PC and view it here? Nope, it all just gets put in with everything else, not even put into its own Album. Want to put photos into an album? Hope it's only a couple, because you have to click each photo one by one, no batch selecting. I'd list more, but reviews are limited to only 500 characters.",2,5/11/2024 9:14

Candyman,I hope you don't have to delete anything because if you do please allow yourself 10 minutes per photo. You will not be able to continue on until each photo that gives you a banner to inform you that you deleted your photo that will last 5-10 minutes until it fades away. It is the most ridiculous and retarded waste of time that I have seen in a long time and do not understand how it is a good idea and mandatory for it to be in the way.

Joe Piepszowski,"Awful app. Amazon has decided that users are incapable of organizing, sorting, or ordering their own photos. The most basic function of sorting by name does not exist. Want to backup a folder from your PC and view it here? Nope, it all just gets put in with everything else, not even put into its own Album. Want to put photos into an album? Hope it's only a couple, because you have to click each photo one by one, no batch selecting. I'd list more, but reviews are limited to only 500 characters.",2,5/11/2024 9:14

Candyman,I hope you don't have to delete anything because if you do please allow yourself 10 minutes per photo. You will not be able to continue on until each photo that gives you a banner to inform you that you deleted your photo that will last 5-10 minutes until it fades away. It is the most ridiculous and retarded waste of time that I have seen in a long time and do not understand how it is a good idea and mandatory for it to be in the way. Google and Amazon are just way too smart for me I guess.,5,5/11/2024 1:41

Thomas Schmitt,"The fact that you cannot easily multi-select photos like you can in Apl or Ggl photo apps is a major, major shortcoming that really angers me. The app seems designed to specifically make it hard for users to mass delete photos, I assume because Amazon wants the data in those pictures for as long as possible. Therefore, they make it very difficult to perform mass deletion by making mass selection hard. Trust not thine photos with Amazon.",1,5/8/2024 20:05

            your PC and view it here? Nope, it all just gets put in with everything else, not even put into its own
            Album. Want to put photos into an album? Hope it's only a couple, because you have to click each photo one

            your device. Basic info isn't readily available (location, what folder it is in, etc). No option to delete

Katie Skellenger,"App is clunky and second-rate compared to other similar apps. I can't believe the lack of

            paying for photo storage. Cause who wants to individually select hundreds of photos. *** I figured it out.

            all photos.",1,"May 8, 2024"
Rob Oliver,"Unlimited free storage for prime member is great, automatic backup is nice. The app is
            another story. It has zero features for managing/organizing photos. Only download, add to album, edit,

            folders from a PC. But there is no access to folders in the app. No way to relocate, rename, or even

susan ross,"I'm changing my review. I did discover how to edit photos again when the app was changed.
            Very nice. Now, I recently discovered the app has been once again 'updated' once again. Updating is not

Thomas Schmitt,"The fact that you cannot easily multi-select photos like you can in Apl or Ggl photo apps is
            a major, major shortcoming that really angers me. The app seems designed to specifically make it hard for

            possible. Therefore, they make it very difficult to perform mass deletion by making mass selection hard.

Sean Quinn,"Warning! This app makes ALL your photos and videos available to anyone who has access to
            your Amazon account, AND (more importantly) if you have an Alexa Show, it indiscriminately starts showing
            them on there. I gave one to my parents so they could talk to my kids and suddenly ALL of my pictures are
            randomly showing. Amazon also makes it extremely difficult to delete the photos all at once. I'm furious.

Bert Therrien,"Great alternative to Google Photo App, or an addition to it. I use Amazon, Google, Asurion,

            not all of them, going back several years. The only problem with Amazon Photos, and Google Photos, is they

            easy to use and share photos. Now I don't know what I'm going to do. Maybe they want people to stop using
            Amazon Photos because it's costing them too much server money to keep up with now? I'm definitely going to

            away. In the Amazon Photos app. It's so amazing that they literally have every picture that I have ever
            taken even some that I thought were lost forever. Absolutely one of the greatest photo app I have ever used

            automatic folders created helps to keep organizing easy, plus if you need to create additional folders, then
            the world is your oyster. My ultimate fav is ordering dynamic prints of your photos. Familiar w/Google
            Photos? You'll recognize options like different canvas sizes, metal prints, etc. This beats Google Photos bc

            no one but myself can copyright them. I deleted the app immediately after I read that. Also there's no trash
            can to make sure your photos are deleted and it's not an easy app to use. You're better off using Google

Steven Kielkucki,"This app only presents historic photos in portrait mode and is unable to adjust to
            landscape. So anytime you take a picture and you try to turn it to its proper format, it fails and returns
            you to a starting point. I'm certain that others have mentioned this over the last two years, but Amazon
            (and Mr. Bezos) don't care because they (he) have (has) locked you in and still gain income and personal
            info from the photos.",2,"November 25, 2023"
Charles Parent,"Amazon photo gives me peace of mind knowing that my photos are backed up. Not on my device
            which can be lost or a hard drive in my house which could be damaged and is vulnerable to fire. It's an
            insurance policy for my memories. My one complaint is the app keeps nagging me to backup folders that I do
            not want backed up such as GIPHY and Bitmoji even though these folders are not selected. Yes, if a new
            folder is discovered, please notify me. Don't notify me if it has been ignored before.",4,"November 24, 2023"
Zach Garner,"This app is an afterthought of an afterthought. Picture selection is a pain using the
            ridiculous tiny thumbnails. Mass deleting junk photos is a pain. Navigating the weird interface is a pain.
            And the one place I thought this would shine is digital picture frame integration, but no. Aside from
            backing every photo I ever take (that's a lot of junk I don't want) this app is just a pain to use and
            misses every opportunity to be useful by instead just being another dumb backup application.",2,"April 14, 2024"
JosÃ© FiÃºza,"Great for saving images, perhaps mainly because it's got no space limit. A few features are

Lorne Higginson,"I'm knocking 2 stars off due to Frustrating user interface issues. The older version of the
            app was actually better. Uploads are turned off but I kept getting upload paused notifications. I had to
            turn all notifications off as it wasn't clear any notification setting was working. Functions are
            confusingly spread across buttons and a button drawer. When you pull the drawer up the buttons disappear.

            backup? Well that brings me to this app's biggest flaw: when performing a backup, my entire home network's
            bandwidth is used and nobody can use the Internet until it is done, which takes a ridiculous amount of time

            is about a 0.0 rating. All Amazon cares about is making more and more money I guess 20 billion is not enough

            you only what you selectively backed up to your Amazon acc then it would be more useful, but afaics it
            doesn't. I don't want everything on my phone backed up, so I turn the auto backup feature off. However it
            shows everything on your phone like a gallery app, even with the auto backup feature turned off. Limiting
            it's usefulness considerably.",3,"March 10, 2021"
A Google user,"It's great. Love that it pretty much can replace the Google Photos service but there's one
            thing. 5GB storage? That's sad in 2019. It's sad especially when the competition is offering 3 times as much
            (free).;I mean, clearly this isn't about US customs but rather data collection, AI face detection and
            tracking, etc... but at least do it right. Put up free decent storage.",3,"October 17, 2019"
Sig Weber,"Switched from Google photos, so far does what I expected. The only feature it lacks compared
            to Google is that it always keeps a local copy of each photo. With Google photos I could free-up local
            storage and keep the files in the cloud until accessed forcing to download a copy. Looks like I have to do
            this manually now on the device. It would be nice if Amazon Photos would have a similar feature like Google
            Photos to clean up locally after uploading and reminding me each time I open the app.",3,"August 27, 2023"
Paul Robinson,"I've used Amazon photos for years now and always been happy with it. It used to be 5 stars
            but after the latest update it's down to just 1 star. So disappointing I just can't understand how the
            developers see these changes as improvements. Auto rotate no longer works when viewing photos, the ""on this
            day"" memories feature which used to work seamlessly is now clunky jumping back to the top of the page after
            viewing every picture so have to scroll down again. Delete from phone opt also gone",1,"January 8, 2023"
Sharon Harrett,"So easy to use and a wonderful way to turn my phone photos into real pictures. Also
            economical.",5,"February 18, 2024"
A Google user,"Phenomenal liberation for the memory space of my phone. Always omnipresent and always just
            the click of a button away from taking all the image-based spatial load from my phone. For the price though,
            I'd prefer more video storage space and also perhaps an easier way to keep the images segmented and/or
            organised. Thanks Amazon for a generally great product.",4,"November 2, 2019"
Alex Howell,"Not a default gallery app (should be), the UI is poorly designed, settings missing a variety
            of options including battery level limit to halt downloads, unable to automatically upload photos added
            (seems to not work, just checked, it is on and the new picture I took is still not uploaded, should have
            been quickly done). The lack of this being a gallery means 2 apps for one process, the UI should be ""out of
            the way"" to allow maximum viewing area.",2,"November 7, 2023"
Tiberiu Gherasim,"Keeps full quality of images but photo sharing and browsing is primitive compared to Google
            and the new update made it even worse. You can have only one shared folder and within that folder you can't
            jump to specific time or date. If you have 50k photos you have to scroll down for ages if you want to see
            older photos. This update is so bad it makes me want to move to another platform.",2,"December 20, 2022"
Sue Jorgensen,Many photos of my Mom who just passed away . Easy access with dates. Love it.,5,"April 25, 2024"
Findlaigh Shawe,"If Amazon Photos was a human being it would be that partner we've all known; congenial,
            gifted, charming and utterly unreliable. Promises are made but never kept, errands are ignored, there's a
            lot of napping or stoned lethargy...but the sex is great. This app's version of great sex is its file and
            folder management but uploads and downloads just don't happen - no error messages, just empty promises and
            invisible files.",3,"June 9, 2020"
Jan-Christian Zaluski,"The most un-user friendly app ever. You can't even access your albums from the home page,
            select all when you want all images in a folder or download your images to the device. Neither will it
            replicate album structure set up offline and won't connect to other photo apps which you can do things like
            a collage. Editing awful., it just bundles all images together. Only using it now as a backup store as free
            with Prime",1,"April 15, 2021"
BARRY CHUNG,Great place to back up all your photo and all you photo editing.,4,"April 3, 2024"
A Google user,"The best app I've found for photo storage and multi-device sync so far, and completely free
            which is great. The only thing I'd like to see improved is the auto save feature, as seems to quite
            regularly glitch on my S8 (uploading infinite time despite pics already being uploaded) and always hassles
            me about adding new folders which I can't disable. But minor points on the whole.",4,"September 13, 2018"
john stevenson,Great app. Keeps all of my pictures organized and is very user friendly,5,"March 19, 2024"
A Google user,"This app should allow you to share what you want to share. Not just the option to access
            your entire photo and video library. You can not delete anything from the app without it deleting from your
            phone. It's also ridiculously unorganized, you can only sort by the date it was loaded not by folder. I just
            wanted to upload 1 specific folder of Disney pics but they were all loaded a different times over the past 7
            yrs so I have to go and click all of them through the last 7 yrs. No thanks! Stupid.",1,"April 11, 2020"
Sharon,Love having access to all my photos and able to put them on my Amazon Alexa devices,5,"May 8, 2024"
Christian B.,"Sorting, albums, search are all far behind of anything current organizing and storage
            applications would provide. If I click into an album, it opens an entry album, saying there is nothing in
            there. Sorting allows by attributes such as ""date uploaded"" and ""date taken"", which is more than Amazon
            Drive offers, but that's a whole different (worse) level of insufficient. No extra features. Family Vault is
            not explained properly, I wonder how usage count of that is.",1,"August 10, 2021"
Guilherme Taffarel Bergamin,"Amazon Prime clients do not have unlimited storage in my country for some weird reason.
            Doesn't even have a way to access your trash items to permanently delete them, so I can't even make some
            space for the photos I need backed up. Everybody should move to Yandex Disk. It is free and has unlimited
            photos backup with the trade off of ads, which is fair. Get rid of all your Amazon products. They are a
            scam. I still can't believe how a company that provides such low quality products can be this big",1,"February 7, 2022"
Reinhold Behringer,"This app works very reliably. Good options to control the sync and upload. I only use it to
            automatically upload pictures from my mobile to Amazon Photos. For managing pictures on my Amazon Photos
            account I prefer to use the web. So I do not need any photo management or editing features on this app. I
            prefer the app lean and fast for auto-sync and upload, and so far the app does that well.",5,"February 6, 2021"
HarkHysteria,"Awesome so far... Just want there to be a place you go as soon as you open the app to see
            all photos that are ""on"" the cloud (already uploaded to internet) only and remember that setting. It is nice
            to know which ones from my phone are not yet clouded but that could be separate by default or user
            preference. ---------+One thing that is annoying is that even though I already reviewed it on here it keeps
            asking me to review it again.",4,"September 12, 2020"
Nicholas,"The app is just not great. The interface is confusing, with all photos from the device shown
            and you can't seem to remove entire folders like ""whatsapp images"" from this view. I have many folders of
            junk that I never want to store on a cloud service - how do I get rid of these from the app? The app also
            does not support a two-way sync, so I now have to delete the same photos in two places.",2,"February 11, 2021"
A Google user,"***update 03/11/18 No longer recieving Photos of the day notifications even though turned
            on. This was probably the only thing that kept the app on my phone. Same issue with app running on iOS on
            wife's iPhone. I guess now a disabled feature..... ********* Limited sorting/searching capability Idea of
            smart album good but will only work against lowest level directory, no use if nested sub directories of
            sorted photos. Generally good app for 100s to a few thousand photos any more and limitations start to show.

Chris Shields,"Full quality photos and videos. So has an edge over google photos if you value full
            definition photos. Facial recognition is a little inaccurate so I would like to see some improvement there.
            It would also be great if a 'remove duplicate' feature was included as myself and my wife share an account
            and often have the same photo uploaded. All in all I'm sticking with amazon photos over the competition and
            I pay for the extra storage for videos. Would like to see 3extra features to help with albums",4,"September 10, 2020"

Jane McCarthy,"Absolutely awful. If it wasn't for trying to make a screensaver for my firestick I wouldn't
            bother. First of all, you have to upload pictures one by one as it takes that long to upload them (overnight
            for 3 photos!) If you then want to add them to an already existing album it is not intuitive and lots of
            clicking around the app. Absolutely awful",1,"June 28, 2020"
Lancashire Lass,"I've used Amazon Photos for a while & fine it a really good app. I'm able to put photos
            in folders & there are other options I can use to fine older photos such as by face recognition or place
            which is brilliant. I have found that some of my old photos have synchronised & duplicated & when
            I've tried to sort these out it hasn't worked. I'm sure there will be a way. I did test an idea on a photo I
            didn't mind if it got deleted which didn't work.. it hot deleted! So back to the board. ð",5,"August 30, 2020"
Alan Gru,"The simplest cave man app ever. There's no select all options. There's no auto select

            create an album when you upload an album. You can't select all from an album. There's a giant ""memories""
            banner instead of being able to see folders and albums. Daily shuffle...does your PO have a phone to see how

Peggy Fung,"The app works well, I am enjoying it and I use it everyday. Cons: - can't tell if photo is

            many clicks - ability to view albums as grid or list. Reduce scrolling if there's many albums Pros: - albums
            - share photos within the text chat (and not as a link) - memories, - pick which folders to backup -

Darknoor âKrad Deâ,"Navigation to choose photos is horribe! No search, no resizing, no sorting, no nothing. It's
            impossible to find photos to go in the same album from the thousands I have! Edit: found out ways to do so,
            in the weirdest sections. The UI is not pretty. I wish there was an option to use a photo of an uploaded
            folder as a bg every day.",3,"August 31, 2022"
Jack Adrian Zappa,"This app has no network control. It will attempt to use a large portion of network pipe
            without regard for anyone else on it, resulting in intermittent network access by everyone on the network. I
            understand that you want to get the initial download done ASAP, but you shouldn't do that without thought to
            the User eXperience. I had to disable it's access to WIFI as I couldn't find ANY pause button, and then I'd
            forget to turn WIFI back on when I'd not be needing the network. This should have very low network priority.
            Also, when I don't care if it uses my network, it would inexplicably pause, making it actually never
            complete. Had to have it run in the foreground with talkback on to allow me to track its progress audibly
            while not using the network to try and keep it downloading. VERY poor UX. If I could give it 0 stars or
            less, I would.",1,"December 27, 2021"
K Williams,"Excellent and safe way to look after and store my photography collection. I really like that
            the app creates gentle memory joggers in the form of random auto selected images then notifies you to view
            them. These are always a welcome pleasure/diversion and often a surprise to see again. ie. My photography
            began at age 20 and has continued for over 46 years so my collection is fairly vast. I'm fussy about quality

            photos on your phone, they aren't deleted from Amazon Photo (HUGE perk for photographers) - They has an

            turn off automatic uploads...which defeats the purpose of a cloud storage doing its thing in the background.

            set a time per day or per week to upload photos. It's too excessive and has been overheating my phone and

            honestly it looks a complete mess. I liked that it removed photos from Amazon and my device when I deleted
            images, but now it only deletes them from Amazon. So it doesn't work as a way of keeping my photos clutter
            free like it used to. Just overall really disappointed that they've ruined what was a decent app before.

            Amazon is a massive company. There could be a more modern design similar to Google photos. Please consider

            rubbish app with pathetically low storage limits is disappointing to say the least. Edit: And now it just

            show you images from folders that you don't want to backup, meaning the photo app is littered with photos

            with the first word of each title; etc... So much basic usability missing, if a garage startup developer
            were to release this app, I'd tell them to finish it beforehand. Which shouldn't take more than a few weeks.

Domonique Walden,"I downloaded this app so I could transfer my files, but the download option is literally
            removed from all of the photos except the two newest ones. It looks like the app is for ordering prints
            ""only."" I refuse to buy prints from Amazon now since they won't let you redownload your own files, so they
            can try to force you to buy your own photos back. Amazon is a multibillion-dollar company that takes your
            files and then tries to sell them back to you when you're already paying for a membership.",1,"July 23, 2020"

            go look for it to disable it. The manage folders option has no select all check nor is there an option to
            not auto pick new folders. I was planning on using the family option. But i cant manage all the unnecessary

            that the way it organizers pictures and videos can be tedious, especially if you have a ton of files.

            such a huge data upload can occur. When I called Amazon, all they said was, ""you should know better"". The

Want to backup a folder from your PC and view it here? Nope, it all just gets put in with everything else, not even put into its own Album. Want to put photos into an album? Hope it's only a couple, because you have to click each photo one by one, no batch selecting. I'd list more, but reviews are limited to only 500 characters.",2,5/11/2024 9:14

Candyman,I hope you don't have to delete anything because if you do please allow yourself 10 minutes per photo. You will not be able to continue on until each photo that gives you a banner to inform you that you deleted your photo that will last 5-10 minutes until it fades away. It is the most ridiculous and retarded waste of time that I have seen in a long time and do not understand how it is a good idea and mandatory for it to be in the way.

            (yes, that's a thing), but because the public IP is from a cellular carrier, this app thinks I'm on a
            cellular connection and won't upload photos ... ""Waiting for WiFi"" even though I'm connected to the WiFi
            network the router broadcasts. The setting about using cellular data for ""auto-upload"" doesn't do anything

A Google user,"As a Prime member I think only 5 GB of video storage is unacceptable. I haven't taken the

            that I want to view since a lot of comments were made about having to search thru many photos to find the
            one, only to have it open up a totally different pic. Another reason I can't comment on the features is that
            I can't get my pics to upload to the site...it's on permanent pause and I can't get it to restart. It's been

Kahlil Nurse,"The only good thing about this app is the free photo storage. It's very time consuming to
            organize and share your photos. You have to manually select each photo, instead of being able to drag your
            finger to select multiple. You also can't select all photos uploaded on one day. It's a very simplistic app
            that could work well for someone with only a few photos to manage, but the developers need to take a look at
            Google Photos and Samsung Gallery. Those apps are leagues ahead of this one.",1,"August 10, 2023"

            which usually deletes photos from your device if you make any changes in the cloud. Amazon offers a no
            frills backup from selected folders. A negative - the app does not give access to the trash folder to
            reinstate deletions. To do this you need to use the web. I won't be using Amazon for my cloud storage, it's

Joe Piepszowski,"Awful app. Amazon has decided that users are incapable of organizing, sorting, or ordering their own photos. The most basic function of sorting by name does not exist. Want to backup a folder from your PC and view it here? Nope, it all just gets put in with everything else, not even put into its own Album. Want to put photos into an album? Hope it's only a couple, because you have to click each photo one by one, no batch selecting. I'd list more, but reviews are limited to only 500 characters.",2,5/11/2024 9:14

roni kissell,I love knowing my photos are safe! Thank you Amazon Photos! Update: Still as good as its always been.Update; this app is totally worth having Prime alone- it doesn't lose your pictures- ever!,5,5/11/2024 3:40
Candyman,I hope you don't have to delete anything because if you do please allow yourself 10 minutes per photo. You will not be able to continue on until each photo that gives you a banner to inform you that you deleted your photo that will last 5-10 minutes until it fades away. It is the most ridiculous and retarded waste of time that I have seen in a long time and do not understand how it is a good idea and mandatory for it to be in the way. Google and Amazon are just way too smart for me I guess.,5,5/11/2024 1:41

Thomas Schmitt,"The fact that you cannot easily multi-select photos like you can in Apl or Ggl photo apps is a major, major shortcoming that really angers me. The app seems designed to specifically make it hard for users to mass delete photos, I assume because Amazon wants the data in those pictures for as long as possible. Therefore, they make it very difficult to perform mass deletion by making mass selection hard. Trust not thine photos with Amazon.",1,5/8/2024 20:05

Farhana Sufi,"I want to rate it 5for the unlimited photo storage for Prime members, but the app's manual upload mode is the worst! It keeps hanging while uploading photos, doesn't allow me the option to ""select all"", and often doesn't give me the option to go back to manual upload once it has hanged, I had to reinstall several times. The web version from a PC is better, but I need to first transfer all my photos to my PC!",2,5/5/2024 9:15

Joseph Portz,"Seems to work about half,i would be very reluctant to give up my photo on Google at this point. I have 1700 photos that won't up load so at this point this app is novelty at best.Even this review process is about half. You should be telling me if i can print,back up photos,and buy photos!

The search tool is useless: I have several photos with barcodes in them, and when searching for ""barcode"" shows zero results. Google Photos has much much better AI search tool. Keeps imposing adding new folders to photo uploads, when I clearly have defined that I only want one folder to be uploaded. Once in a while other folders are being uploaded without my consent.",1,5/3/2024 10:12
