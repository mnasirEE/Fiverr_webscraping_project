Jay Bee,"Corruption at Nevada VA hospitals! I believe that justin is using Burp Suit, Frida, ADB Shell, Javascript, google Firebase, and/or AndroGoat for stalking, harassment, identity theft, and cyber crimes. I viewed some information about SSL/TLS Bypass and I am experincing the same problems. VR&E is supposed to help disabled veterans get training to obtain suitable employment. They aren't supposed to allow racist corrupt employees to abuse them by doing identity fraud or illegal cyber Maybe internati",1,5/17/2024 7:49

The application/interface as a whole is OK, but there are some areas for improvement. -1 star for not automatically sorting images into the album names they were uploaded from. -1 star for taking away the feature that allowed users to delete photos from the cloud and local storage simultaneously.

Ted B,Been using Amazon photos for years was working very well. But today I tried signing in and it keeps saying something went wrong. After talking to customer service rep found out my account had been locked due to unauthorized attempted log in. After talking to five different Representatives over two days. I cannot get the account unlocked. They told me wait for an email from support. 7 Days later nothing. I called him back still unable to unlock my account.

Joe Piepszowski,"Awful app. Amazon has decided that users are incapable of organizing, sorting, or ordering their own photos. The most basic function of sorting by name does not exist. Want to backup a folder from your PC and view it here? Nope, it all just gets put in with everything else, not even put into its own Album. Want to put photos into an album? Hope it's only a couple, because you have to click each photo one by one, no batch selecting. I'd list more, but reviews are limited to only 500 characters.",2,5/11/2024 9:14

Candyman,I hope you don't have to delete anything because if you do please allow yourself 10 minutes per photo. You will not be able to continue on until each photo that gives you a banner to inform you that you deleted your photo that will last 5-10 minutes until it fades away. It is the most ridiculous and retarded waste of time that I have seen in a long time and do not understand how it is a good idea and mandatory for it to be in the way. Google and Amazon are just way too smart for me I guess.,5,5/11/2024 1:41
