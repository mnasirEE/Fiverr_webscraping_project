Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."
Lyala meme,,I thought this was amazing untilâ¦,,I thought this was amazing untilâ¦ the day I bought a MacBook Pro and it said it would take like 3 days so I waited 3 days and it was not there I called customer service and they said they were going to get me a new one and then I got a call from them and they said they canât they have to find my old package and they never did so I bought another one and it happened all over again so I just went to the store and they said they were going to get me a refund and they did and I got 2 and I gave it to a customer who said the same thing happened but only once and that was the end of that and me and her did not get our money back but whatever at least it was over and that was all I care about
jadon said ut,,The Upgrades,,"So, yea I donât like appple because I have 2 daughters and only one of my daughter phone upgrades automatically but my other daughterâs phones doesnât.I got confused so I called apple but when I call them no one answers so I try again but no one answers so now I just upgrade my daughters phone since it can upgrade on itâs on. Apple please fix this issue. Also, the Apple Store now using password which is annoying because my daughters love roblox but they come to me saying,â Dad can you put in the passwordâ. This had got me confused because when did you have to start using a password to update a app but when I put the password in it keeps saying itâs wrong. Apple please fix these issues itâs kinda getting annoying."
KENDALL0998776126,,I will be during apple,,Apple I done with updating my phone every 2 seconds also my phone keeps Turing on and back off it so annoying yall really need to stop scamming people for dumb items yes yâall have good quality but itâs annoying Idc if yâall say well you got scammed Iâm not gonna get scammed. Yâall are gonna get scammed because youâre not even gonna get scammed cause I am sueing  yaâll these Apple products are good or whatever but Iâm so sick of having to update my phone every five seconds. Iâm sick of it turning on and off by itself these phones are lagging. I update my phone and it says it supposed to be a better update but itâs not. Itâs horrible. I literally update my phone not even a whole hour ago and itâs lagging. Yâall need to fix it fix it now.
dacappstoreus,,Bad Apple service,,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."
BabyBree2712,,Great way if you donât want to come into the store,,I recently bought an iPhone 13 pro max and some AirPod pros I really do like the concept of just having a shop online because the Apple stores are constantly packed with people who like looking and admiring at the technology (which I donât blame itâs nice) but Iâm there knowing what I want and what to buy. The scheduled courier delivery was really good as well I scheduled the night before and it came around 2pm the next day and everything was nicely packaged and boxed up safely.
henrrita,,Top 7,,"This is just one of many, I just added this game and itâs relaxing and kinda fun.  I wish I could watch it. But you see very little of the actual game, it is mostly ads. And not short ads.  So, sadlly Iâll just keep looking till I find another one that doesnât run them constantly and is smart enough to make them brief so folks can maybe  enjoy the game.  This one is hopeless, I have no ideawhy itâs even on here, and thatâs too bad because I liked it andmaybe the folks willing to pay to have ads removed handle it that way.  Iâm not going to do that and if I was it woukd not be to these people that should manage this game time much better. Why woukd any of us choose to look at one ad after another at the end of the dayâ¦.."
Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.
who onew,,NOT HAPPY AT ALL!,,"I have been told not to allow my old phone to accept software updates. After the relentless pop ups asking for the software updates, (and much to my hesitation) I didâ¦and yes my phone, that I really liked a lot, and that was in perfect condition, crashed. And guess whatâ¦ this multimillion dollar company has no one that is able to fix my phone! They offered to mail it off (for over $300) but no guarantee it could be fixed. If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway. So it worked, let the software updates happen and we crash your phone, and your are forced to buy a new one now! The old one lasted much longer than we thought or wanted! ð¡Not a very happy camper!"
Blue-Moon-Dragonfly,,Great - Apple is a ripoff! Canât update App Store because I canât run iOS 13!,,"Outrageous! Apple is not only extremely expensive â it is a frustrating RIPOFF! I own 4 iOS devices and a MacBook Pro. Now, my iPads are obsolete and no longer supported because I cannot install iOS 13, in order to update other apple apps that I have already spent a fortune on! Including Charging cables that change with every product upgrade. Your business model and markup is unconscionable and untenable. You are consistently proving to be a poorer and poorer product value for the for the cost. Do not mistake my criticism and product re-evaluation for some convoluted delusion of self entitlementâitâs not. The truth is you are nothing better than an opportunistic Carpetbagger! Good luck with that!"

dacappstoreus,,Bad Apple service,,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway.

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway. So it worked, let the software updates happen and we crash your phone, and your are forced to buy a new one now!

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.

They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."

Apple please fix this issue. Also, the Apple Store now using password which is annoying because my daughters love roblox but they come to me saying,â Dad can you put in the passwordâ.

It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery.

A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

dacappstoreus,,Bad Apple service,,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway.

They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway. So it worked, let the software updates happen and we crash your phone, and your are forced to buy a new one now!

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.

They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."

Apple please fix this issue. Also, the Apple Store now using password which is annoying because my daughters love roblox but they come to me saying,â Dad can you put in the passwordâ.

It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery.

dacappstoreus,,Bad Apple service,,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway. So it worked, let the software updates happen and we crash your phone, and your are forced to buy a new one now!

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.

They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.

They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Apple please fix this issue. Also, the Apple Store now using password which is annoying because my daughters love roblox but they come to me saying,â Dad can you put in the passwordâ. This had got me confused because when did you have to start using a password to update a app but when I put the password in it keeps saying itâs wrong.

It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery.

A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it.

And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

dacappstoreus,,Bad Apple service,,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway. So it worked, let the software updates happen and we crash your phone, and your are forced to buy a new one now!

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.

They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."

Apple please fix this issue. Also, the Apple Store now using password which is annoying because my daughters love roblox but they come to me saying,â Dad can you put in the passwordâ.

It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery.

A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

dacappstoreus,,Bad Apple service,,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway.

They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway. So it worked, let the software updates happen and we crash your phone, and your are forced to buy a new one now!

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.

They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."

Donottrade,,Beware of trade in offer,,"The process for buying a phone is easy.  You pay full price for the phone, and they give you a trade offer based on your description of your current phone.  Apple makes is easy to return your phone back for a trade in.  The problem comes when you receive the email AFTER they have your old phone.  They automatically reduce your trade value to a lessor amount.  When you decline, they ship your old phone back, but it may arrive in a damaged condition.  Now I have my old phone back in a condition that is not worth reselling.  Save yourself the time and trouble and just throw your old phone in the trash (after you deletes it contents of course)."
Lyala meme,,I thought this was amazing untilâ¦,,I thought this was amazing untilâ¦ the day I bought a MacBook Pro and it said it would take like 3 days so I waited 3 days and it was not there I called customer service and they said they were going to get me a new one and then I got a call from them and they said they canât they have to find my old package and they never did so I bought another one and it happened all over again so I just went to the store and they said they were going to get me a refund and they did and I got 2 and I gave it to a customer who said the same thing happened but only once and that was the end of that and me and her did not get our money back but whatever at least it was over and that was all I care about
jadon said ut,,The Upgrades,,"So, yea I donât like appple because I have 2 daughters and only one of my daughter phone upgrades automatically but my other daughterâs phones doesnât.I got confused so I called apple but when I call them no one answers so I try again but no one answers so now I just upgrade my daughters phone since it can upgrade on itâs on. Apple please fix this issue. Also, the Apple Store now using password which is annoying because my daughters love roblox but they come to me saying,â Dad can you put in the passwordâ. This had got me confused because when did you have to start using a password to update a app but when I put the password in it keeps saying itâs wrong. Apple please fix these issues itâs kinda getting annoying."
KENDALL0998776126,,I will be during apple,,Apple I done with updating my phone every 2 seconds also my phone keeps Turing on and back off it so annoying yall really need to stop scamming people for dumb items yes yâall have good quality but itâs annoying Idc if yâall say well you got scammed Iâm not gonna get scammed. Yâall are gonna get scammed because youâre not even gonna get scammed cause I am sueing  yaâll these Apple products are good or whatever but Iâm so sick of having to update my phone every five seconds. Iâm sick of it turning on and off by itself these phones are lagging. I update my phone and it says it supposed to be a better update but itâs not. Itâs horrible. I literally update my phone not even a whole hour ago and itâs lagging. Yâall need to fix it fix it now.
dacappstoreus,,Bad Apple service,,"I am Apple loyal client for years but my recent experience with Apple service was horrible. I bought a Beats Flex and it died suddenly. I brought it to an Apple Store and they sent it to service. A few days later they told me that a mesh inside is missing and refused to service it unless I pay $59 (the headset itself is sold for $69 and you can buy it for $39 at BestBuy). It is ridiculous that I have no reason to open the earpiece to remove a mesh. They were not any reasonable in listening to me but insisted if I do not pay, they will not fix it, although they admitted the issue was with the bad battery. I could never imagine Apple having such a kind of service. I am very frustrated and it would be the last Apple product I buy."
BabyBree2712,,Great way if you donât want to come into the store,,I recently bought an iPhone 13 pro max and some AirPod pros I really do like the concept of just having a shop online because the Apple stores are constantly packed with people who like looking and admiring at the technology (which I donât blame itâs nice) but Iâm there knowing what I want and what to buy. The scheduled courier delivery was really good as well I scheduled the night before and it came around 2pm the next day and everything was nicely packaged and boxed up safely.

And not short ads.  So, sadlly Iâll just keep looking till I find another one that doesnât run them constantly and is smart enough to make them brief so folks can maybe  enjoy the game.  This one is hopeless, I have no ideawhy itâs even on here, and thatâs too bad because I liked it andmaybe the folks willing to pay to have ads removed handle it that way.  Iâm not going to do that and if I was it woukd not be to these people that should manage this game time much better. Why woukd any of us choose to look at one ad after another at the end of the dayâ¦.."
Copahc,,Stop lying about review scores!!!!!,,So many apps are horrible and have tons and tons of negative reviews but yet they still have 4.5 review scores. Why?  Stop rigging it. Itâs false advertisement. You wast our time and money telling us terrible apps are great all so that crappy developers can make money selling their crappy apps. And how about actually monitoring the ads they place in the apps?? I finally found a game I like to play but lâm completely inundated with sexist ads for other sexist apps that I donât want to see. Itâs ridiculous. They make women look like trash. I would love to know where a can make an actual real complaint about the sexist app. I canât give it a negative review because it wonât matter. It will still have a fake 4.5 star rating.

And guess whatâ¦ this multimillion dollar company has no one that is able to fix my phone! They offered to mail it off (for over $300) but no guarantee it could be fixed. If by chance they could fix it, it would be wiped clean and Iâd loss everything anyway.
